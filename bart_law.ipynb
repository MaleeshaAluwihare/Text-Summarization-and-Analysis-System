TITLE: FIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT TEXT: [*1] Plaintiff Susan Stocking brings this case on behalf of herself and all other women employed by AT&T Corp. (\"AT&T\") who have been discriminated against by their employer, AT&T, and its affiliated companies, and would show the Court as follows: I. Jurisdiction, Venue, and Parties\\n1. Plaintiff Susan Stocking is a citizen of the state of Missouri, was employed by Defendant, and has filed an EEOC complaint and obtained the right to sue. See attached Decision (attached as \"Exhibit A\") and right-to-sue letter (attached as \"Exhibit B\").\\n2. AT&T employs Plaintiff and thousands [**2] of other women like her. AT&T is a citizen of the states of New\\n\\n\\x0c2003 U.S. Dist. Ct. Pleadings 3030, *1; 2004 U.S. Dist. Ct. Pleadings LEXIS 9181, **2\\n\\nPage 2\\n\\nYork where it is incorporated and of New Jersey where its principal place of business is located; and can be served with service of process at The Corporation Company, Inc., 515 S. Kansas Ave., Topeka, KS 66603.\\n3. Aetna Insurance Company (\"Health Insurer\") was a health insurer for Plaintiff and/or AT&T.\\n[*2] 4. Venue is proper in this Court as Defendant does business in this judicial district and has offered or provided health insurance to its employees in this judicial district. 28 U.S.C. § 1391 (b) and (c); 42 U.S.C. § 2000e 5(f)(3).\\n5. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction based on federal question jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. § 1331, and 42 U.S.C. § 2000e - 5(f)(3).\\nA. Summary of Claims\\n6. Prescription medication related to reproduction is routinely covered for men, but not for women. Prescription contraception, which is used only by women, is a basic prescription medication related to reproduction; specifically, it prevents pregnancy for women who wish to do so by reversible means. Plaintiff, on [**3] behalf of herself and all others similarly situated, brings this class action against AT&T for sex discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq. and the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA), 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(k) for offering and/or providing health insurance that does not cover prescription contraceptives for women related to reproduction while covering sex-related prescription medication for men, such as Viagra.\\n7. AT&T\\'s exclusion of prescription contraception has an adverse disparate impact on Ms. Stocking and other members of the proposed class. Because prescription contraceptives are available for use only by women, AT&T\\'s failure to provide coverage for prescription contraception forces its female employees to choose between paying their own out-of-pocket prescription costs, or bearing the physical, emotional and financial costs of an unplanned pregnancy.\\n8. As a result of AT&T decision to exclude contraceptives from its benefits plan, Ms. Stocking and other members of the proposed class are being discriminated against in the [*3] terms and conditions of employment, [**4] which includes receipt of benefits under fringe benefit programs, because of their potential for pregnancy. This violates Title VII.\\nB. Plaintiff Susan Stocking\\n9. Plaintiff Susan Stocking has been employed by AT&T on a full-time basis since June 12, 1995. As part of the terms and conditions of her employment, Ms. Stocking receives health insurance coverage, including coverage of prescription drugs and devices. Ms. Stocking sues on her own behalf and as a representative of the proposed class of employees who are discriminated against by the exclusion of contraception from AT&T\\'s benefit plan.\\n10. Ms. Stocking was, at all times relevant to this cause of action, a woman of childbearing age who was concerned with the prevention of an unwanted or unplanned pregnancy. Ms. Stocking requested that her prescription health care benefit provide or reimburse her for the cost of birth control. Her requests were denied. Subsequently, Ms. Stocking learned that men were provided and received plan coverage of a full range of conditions that can be treated through prescription medication.\\n11. On August 26, 2002, Ms. Stocking filed a charge with the EEOC at its Kansas City Area Office [**5] in Kansas City, Kansas alleging that AT&T\\'s failure to provide her with health insurance coverage for prescription contraceptives constitutes unlawful discrimination on the basis of sex.\\n12. As a result, Ms. Stocking received a decision and a right-to-sue letter from the EEOC (copies of which are attached hereto as \"Exhibit A\" and Exhibit B\").\\n\\n\\x0c2003 U.S. Dist. Ct. Pleadings 3030, *3; 2004 U.S. Dist. Ct. Pleadings LEXIS 9181, **5\\n\\nPage 3\\n\\n[*4] 13. On November 29, 2002, the EEOC issued a \"Determination\" to Plaintiff Susan Stocking, in which it considered AT&T\\'s benefit plan and concluded that:\\n\"...it is the Commission\\'s position that the pre-July 2002 exclusion violates both Title VII and the PDA, since the statutes cover prescription contraceptives regardless of their intended purpose. Prescription contraceptives are available only for women. As a result, Respondent\\'s pre-July 2002 policy is, by definition, a sex-based exclusion...It appears that Respondent\\'s current plan uniquely classifies contraceptives used for birth control purposes by requiring their acquisition solely by mail. This also represents a sex-based distinction and violates the statutes. Coverage for prescription contraceptives must be afforded in the same manner as if the woman, or any employee, [**6] sought other preventive or health maintenance services.\\n14. AT&T\\'s refusal to provide the same benefits to both men and women has caused an economic hardship on Ms. Stocking and other members of the proposed class that male employees are not required to endure.\\nII. AT&T\\'s Health Plan\\n15. As terms and conditions of their employment, AT&T offered Ms. Stocking the opportunity to enroll in one of three health plans (Plan). The three options were: Post of Service (POS) option; Traditional Indemnity option (PPO); and Health Maintenance Organization (HMO). The POS offered the highest level of benefits. The PPO option was only offered to those employees who lived outside the POS service area, but allowed selection of physicians and reimbursement after the deductible was met. The HMO option generally had no deductibles to meet, a small co-payment but required participants to see a doctor in the HMO network.\\n16. Regular full-time occupational employees are eligible for coverage at the company\\'s expense on the first day of the month in which the employee attains six months of Net Certified Service with AT&T. Regular full-time employees are not required to contribute to receive [**7] Plan benefits, but with the HMO option, they may be required to do so.\\n[*5] 17. Ms. Stocking elected to take advantage of the PPO option.\\n18. The Plan also provides for a Prescription Drug Benefit Plan which was administered by Merck-Medco (Drug Plan). The Drug Plan provided drug benefits to participants in the POS and PPO options. In general, the Drug Plan covered all drugs provided by a pharmacist at the physician\\'s order unless specifically excluded. The Drug Plan specifically excluded \"[a]ny drugs or medications used solely for birth control, including oral contraceptives, jellies, foams, devices, implants or injections.\"\\n19. Despite covering other preventative medical services and prescriptions, neither the Plan nor the Drug Plan provided for prescription drugs and/or devices used by plaintiffs and other women similarly situated to prevent pregnancy.\\n20. If plaintiff became pregnant, however, the Plan would have covered the costs of either an abortion or continuing the pregnancy to term - whichever she chose to do.\\nIII. Harm to Ms. Stocking and Other Class Members\\n21. As a direct and proximate result of the AT&T Plan\\'s failure to cover contraception [**8] to prevent pregnancy, Ms. Stocking and other proposed members of the class were required to pay for their monthly or periodic contraceptives on an out-of-pocket basis, or risk unintended pregnancy. Like many healthy women of reproductive age, contraception is the only prescription drug Ms. Stocking used on a regular and consistent basis.\\n22. On information and belief, AT&T employs hundreds of women of reproductive age who use prescription contraception.\\n\\n\\x0c2003 U.S. Dist. Ct. Pleadings 3030, *5; 2004 U.S. Dist. Ct. Pleadings LEXIS 9181, **8\\n\\nPage 4\\n\\n23. If contraception were treated on an equal basis with other prescriptions under the Plan and the Drug Plan, Ms. Stocking and other proposed class members would have paid a low co-pay, or no co-pay at all, for generic or brand-name, 34 day supply, of contraception.\\n[*6] IV. Factual Framework\\n24. For over thirty years of their lives, women have the biological potential for pregnancy. Contraception is a drug or device that prevents pregnancy. Without contraception, the average woman would be expected to have between 12 and 15 pregnancies in her lifetime. In any given year, 85 out of 100 sexually active women of reproductive age who do not use contraception will become pregnant. Most American women want only two [**9] children. To achieve that goal, the typical American woman spends roughly three decades - or about 75% of her reproductive life - trying to avoid unintended pregnancy. Of the 60.2 million women of reproductive age, 64% currently use contraception. Ninety-four percent of American women use contraception at some point during their reproductive years. Among all women aged 20-44 who have ever had sexual intercourse, 85% have used prescription oral contraceptives.\\n25. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved five methods of reversible prescription contraception: oral contraception; Norplant; Depo-Provera; intra-uterine device (\"IUD\"); and the diaphragm. Only women can use these methods of prescription contraception. Other forms of contraception are sold over the counter (OTC) and thus generally are not covered by health insurance. The OTC methods include the male condom and five female methods: spermicidal foam, jelly, film, suppositories and the female condom. All methods work either by preventing fertilization of a woman\\'s ovum or by preventing implantation of the blastocyst in the uterine wall.\\n26. Women bear all of the physical burdens of pregnancy, which are quite substantial. [**10] Pregnancy itself can put a woman\\'s life at risk. Ectopic pregnancy is the deadliest complication in the early stages of pregnancy. The three deadliest complications of full-term pregnancy are hemorrhage, hypertension and thrombosis. In the United States today, for every 100,000 births, [*7] 8-22 women (depending on their county of residence) die as a result of pregnancy-related complications.\\n27. Pregnancy also poses non-life threatening health risks for women. The morbidity rate during pregnancy is quite high. Twenty-two percent of all pregnant women are hospitalized before delivery because of various complications. Pre-term labor is one of the most common reasons women are hospitalized before delivery. In such instances, the medical interventions a woman must undergo often include long-term bed rest and administration of various drugs, some of which have significant side effects for the woman.\\n28. The more pregnancies she bears, the greater the likelihood a woman will suffer one or more of the myriad life and/or health-threatening complications of pregnancy. Women who experience a large number of pregnancies are known to be at far greater risk for certain permanent health [**11] problems such as uterine prolapse (downward displacement of the uterus so that some or all of the uterus comes outside of the vagina), rectocele (hernial protrusion of the rectum into the vagina), cystocele (hernial protrusion of the urinary bladder through the vaginal wall), pelvic floor disorders and varicose veins.\\n29. For women with pre-existing medical conditions, even one pregnancy can pose grave health risks. Preexisting medical conditions that are exacerbated by pregnancy include: certain blood diseases, including sickle-cell disease; heart disease; cancer; endocrine disorders such as diabetes; diseases of the nervous system such as epilepsy; kidney and liver diseases; connective tissue disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis; chronic hypertension; respiratory disease including asthma and pneumonia; and HIV present in the blood stream.\\n30. Unintended pregnancy poses far greater health risks to women and children than does intended pregnancy. The medical risks of unintended pregnancy are well documented. In [*8] general, women who become pregnant unexpectedly are less likely to receive adequate pre-natal care and thus have less opportunity [**12] to manage pre-existing medical conditions and other risks during pregnancy. For instance, unintended pregnancy is quite\\n\\n\\x0c2003 U.S. Dist. Ct. Pleadings 3030, *8; 2004 U.S. Dist. Ct. Pleadings LEXIS 9181, **12\\n\\nPage 5\\n\\ndangerous, and may even be deadly, for women with hypertension or diabetes. These conditions are best managed when medical care is begun before conception. In addition, women who become pregnant unexpectedly forego the opportunity to receive pre-conception counseling to improve the health of the fetus and are more likely to have low birth weight babies and experience a higher rate of neonatal mortality.\\n31. Unintended pregnancy is both frequent and widespread in the United States. Forty-nine percent of all pregnancies in the United States are unintended. Among Western Nations, the United States has one of the highest rates of unintended pregnancy. Unintended pregnancy affects all segments of society. Four out of ten pregnancies among married women are unintended. Low-income women and unmarried women experience even higher rates of unintended pregnancy.\\n32. Contraception enables women to plan their pregnancies and time the spacing between pregnancies. The shorter the interval between her pregnancies, the greater the likelihood a woman will experience pre-term labor, [**13] depression and other health problems. Recognizing that contraception is central to the health and well-being of women and their children, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention has recognized that \"[s]maller families and longer birth intervals have contributed to the better health of infants, children, and women, and have improved the social and economic role of women.\"\\n33. Furthermore, even in an otherwise healthy woman, pregnancy poses medical risks that are significantly greater than the risks of using contraception. In any given year, the average risk of death from pregnancy is 1 in 11,000 while the risk of death from contraception is much less: 1 in 63,000 for non-smoking oral contraceptive users; 1 in 100,000 for IUD users; and no risk of death for diaphragm users.\\n[*9] 34. Due to the wide variation in effectiveness, cost, and medical appropriateness of available forms of contraception, choice of contraceptive method is essential to successful pregnancy prevention. Other factors that contribute to what type of contraception a woman chooses to use are whether the woman intends to delay, space, or entirely prevent future childbearing.\\n35. Women with medical conditions [**14] that require pregnancy avoidance, in particular, require a full range of contraceptive options because their medical conditions often preclude the use of one or more contraceptive methods. For example, birth control pills are medically contraindicated for smokers over age 35 and women who are at risk of cardiovascular problems, such as stroke, heart attack, blood clots, and hypertension, as well as women who have, or are at risk of, depression or hepatic adenomas.\\n36. For all of the above reasons, a recent study by the Institute of Medicine recommends improving contraceptive coverage in health plans in order to reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and to improve health outcomes for women and children. Similarly, the United States Department of Health and Human Services has adopted the goal of improving pregnancy planning and spacing and preventing unintended pregnancy. Moreover, the Guidelines for Women\\'s Health Care published by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), which represents 38,000 physicians in this country, advises that \"prevention of unwanted pregnancy\" and \"contraceptive options\" be discussed with all women over the age of 13 during routine [**15] primary care assessments. In sum, contraception is basic to women\\'s health and well-being.\\n37. The physical burdens of pregnancy increase the risk of interruption to a woman\\'s education, career and professional development opportunities. The ability to control her biological [*10] potential for pregnancy is central to a woman\\'s ability to participate in the workplace on an equal basis with men.\\n38. Inadequate insurance coverage of contraception has substantial adverse economic consequences for the 67% of American women of reproductive age who rely on employer-sponsored health insurance coverage. These women pay 68% more in out-of-pocket expenditures for health care services than men, and reproductive health services account for much of that difference.\\n\\n\\x0c2003 U.S. Dist. Ct. Pleadings 3030, *10; 2004 U.S. Dist. Ct. Pleadings LEXIS 9181, **15\\n\\nPage 6\\n\\nV. Statutory Framework\\n39. Title VII provides that: \"It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to ... discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\\'s ... sex.\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(1).\\n40. In 1978, Congress enacted the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (\"PDA\") which provides [**16] that the term \"because of sex\" in Title VII includes, but is not limited to, \"because of or on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions.\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(k). The PDA further states that \"women affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions shall be treated the same for all employment-related purposes, including receipt of benefits under fringe benefit programs as other persons not so affected but similar in their ability or inability to work.\" Id. Thus, Title VII specifically mandates that employers may not single out employees for disadvantageous treatment based on \"pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions.\"\\n41. Contraception is \"pregnancy-related\" within the meaning of the PDA because it is medical treatment that provides women with the ability to control their biological potential for pregnancy. Exclusion of contraception from a health plan is sex discrimination in violation of the PDA because it treats women differently on the basis of their potential to become pregnant. The [*11] exclusion of contraception from the Health Plan is, therefore, sex discrimination on its face in violation of [**17] Title VII, as amended by the PDA.\\n42. The exclusion of contraception from the Health Plan also has an adverse disparate impact on women in violation of Title VII because it forces them either to pay for prescription contraceptives out of pocket, despite having prescription insurance coverage, or to bear the physical, emotional and financial burdens of unplanned pregnancy. Defendant\\'s policy of excluding contraceptive coverage cannot be justified as job-related and consistent with business necessity.\\nVI. Class Action Allegations\\n43. The proposed class of plaintiffs in this case consists of:\\nAll female employees of AT&T Corp. covered or offered to be covered by health insurance who used prescription contraceptives from August , to the present (hereinafter, Plaintiff Class).\\n44. This action is properly maintainable as a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). Plaintiff is informed and believes that the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. AT&T employs thousands of people across the nation, a large percentage of whom are women, who participate in the AT&T health and drug plans. Given the number of qualifying employees and [**18] the well-documented utilization rates for prescription contraceptive drugs and devices, plaintiff is informed and believes that the class consists of at least 100 persons.\\n45. Commonality is met. Plaintiff class members have common issues of law:\\n(i) whether the failure to provide coverage for female prescription contraceptives a violation of Title VII and/or the PDA by disparate treatment or disparate impact;\\n(ii) whether AT&T violated Title VII and/or PDA;\\n(iii) whether Health Insurer violated Title VII and/or PDA;\\n[*12] (iv) the measure of damages for Plaintiffs who obtain contraceptives anyway; and\\n\\n\\x0c2003 U.S. Dist. Ct. Pleadings 3030, *12; 2004 U.S. Dist. Ct. Pleadings LEXIS 9181, **18\\n\\nPage 7\\n\\n(v) the measure of damages for Plaintiffs who did not obtain contraceptives.\\nThe common factual issues are:\\n(i) Did Defendants provide and/or offer health insurance that did not provide coverage for prescription contraceptives for women;\\n(ii) did Defendants cause damages to Plaintiff Class as a result;\\n(iii) what amount of damages resulted from the discrimination to the Plaintiff Class;\\n(iv) whether equitable relief, such as an injunction, should be awarded by the Court.\\n46. The claims of the representative party are typical [**19] of the claims of the class. Ms. Stocking was enrolled in AT&T\\'s health and drug plans during the class period. Like every other member of the class, Ms. Stocking has been denied benefits of her employment based on a pregnancy-related medical condition. Furthermore, the AT&T contraception exclusion has had an adverse disparate impact on her, as it has on other female employees of AT&T.\\n47. Plaintiff is an adequate class representative for the Plaintiff Class and Plaintiff\\'s counsel are experienced in prosecuting nationwide class actions and in federal court litigation.

The common questions of fact or law will predominate over any individual issues as every class member would have the same law applicable to its claims for liability and for damages and the same common questions of fact would have to be presented each time a class member brought suit against Defendants.\\n49. A nationwide class action is superior to any other method to adjudicate the claims of all members of the Plaintiff Class.\\n[*13] 50. This action is properly maintainable as a class action under Fed.

Claims\\nA. Violation of Title VII\\n51. By providing or offering discriminatory health insurance to its employees, AT&T violates Title VII by disparate treatment since the benefit plan for health insurance is discriminatory on its face and by disparate impact because the health insurance excludes coverage for benefits that are uniquely designed for women. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant\\'s violation of Title VII, Plaintiff and other AT&T female employees have suffered damages by paying for prescription contraceptives and are entitled to injunctive relief to prevent further discrimination.\\nB. Violation of Pregnancy Discrimination Act\\n52. In addition to violating Title VII, Defendants have also violated the PDA by disparate treatment and/or disparate impact, causing proximate damages to Plaintiff and entitling her to injunctive relief.\\nVIII.

Woolley, Lathrop & Gage, L.C., Kansas City, MO, Laura M. Franze, Marcia Nelson Jackson, Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld, LLP, Dallas, TX, for Defendant.\\nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER\\nSACHS, District Judge.\\nAs stated in a prior ruling (Doc. 55) plaintiff Susan Stocking has received an EEOC determination that defendant\\'s health care program she had selected contained a restriction that violated her rights as an employee, under Title VII and the Pregnancy Discrimination Act. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq. and 2000e(k). Pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement in effect until July 1, 2002, there was no coverage for contraceptives prescribed for birth control. Such contraceptives thereafter became available for mail-order acquisition under that program.\\nPlaintiff initially sought damages for her past expenditures for prescribed contraceptives and also an injunction against the new mail-order limitations. Class certification was sought. It was denied without prejudice in the prior ruling because plaintiff was not personally opposed to the mailorder system, and had discontinued her contraceptive use. Plaintiff now limits her complaint to the damage claim (amounting to roughly $1 per day) and renews her request for class certification. Cross-motions for summary judgment on the merits have been filed. Defendant also vigorously contests class certification. The essential facts are not in dispute.\\nOral argument and supplemental briefing have recently occurred. For reasons stated below, I will grant plaintiff Stocking summary judgment on the merits but for a limited damage period as advocated by defendant; that is, 300 days before filing of the charge. I will certify a class, with plaintiff as the class representative, for female employees of defendant with similar health insurance who purchased prescribed contraceptives for birth control during the period from October 31, 2001, through the month of June, 2002. Some qualified claimants, like plaintiff herself, will not be entitled to damages for the entire period.\\nProcedurally it would have been preferable to make a class action determination somewhat earlier. That did not occur because of what I concluded was a false start by plaintiff. Now that the class issues and motions going to the merits are ripe for ruling, I believe I should deal with the merits first, which will help place the request for class certification in clear focus.\\n1016 *1016 I.\\nBefore 2002 AT & T offered plans covering prescribed contraceptives for management employees, but only on a mail-order basis. Certain elective programs, such as an HMO option that was available to non-management personnel like plaintiff, also covered prescribed contraceptives. As stated in my earlier ruling, use of the HMO option would apparently have imposed limitations on health coverage that plaintiff did not want, so she was not interested in submitting to that plan in order to get coverage for prescribed contraceptives. Plaintiff discontinued\\n\\n\\x0cprescribed contraceptives several months after October, 2001, and now relies on a single purchase for $101.07 for a three-month supply. Defendant has calculated her potential recovery, after a co-pay deduction, of only $68.07.\\nBecause of the class action potential, given that defendant AT & T is a large employer, the small claim here has been strenuously litigated by both sides.\\nPrior to July, 2002, the exclusion of prescribed contraceptives apparently was treated as a cost-saving device for what the parties to the collective bargaining agreement considered to be nonessential medical treatment. This disregards the sex-related circumstance that the limitation of prescribed contraceptives applies to women only, under current availability conditions, and also disregards the importance of pregnancy or freedom from that condition for women, for health conditions, narrowly defined, and otherwise.\\nI will not fully rehearse the legal issues because that has been done by several district judges. As least one case is on appeal. I now understand that two unpublished decisions favor defendant employer, but their treatment is rather summary or does not discuss contrary authority, which I now find quite compelling. Alexander v. American Airlines, 2002 WL 731815 (N.D.Tex.); Cummins v. State of Illinois, unreported, Case No.2002-CV-4201-JPG (S.D.Ill., Aug. 30, 2005). Three more fully reasoned and published decisions favor plaintiff on the discrimination claim. Erickson v. Bartell Drug. Co., 141 F.Supp.2d 1266 (W.D.Wash.2001); Cooley v. Daimler-Chrysler Corp., 281 F.Supp.2d 979 (E.D.Mo.2003); In re Union Pacific R.R. Employment Practices Litigation, 378 F.Supp.2d 1139 (D.Neb.2005). A sixth decision rejects the Pregnancy Act claim but allows the case to go forward on a Title VII sex discrimination claim. Wright v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., unreported, Case No. 4:03 CV 1873 CDP (E.D.Mo. Jan. 10, 2005).[1]\\nIn my initial reaction to the issues in this case, I noted some skepticism as to the merits because both men and women use contraceptives, just as both men and women may seek treatment for infertility. The same observation appears in Alexander and Cummins. There is controlling appellate authority that the denial to a woman of fertility treatment cannot give rise to a sound claim for discrimination because of sex, either under Title VII or the Pregnancy Discrimination Act. Krauel v. Iowa Methodist Medical Center, 95 F.3d 674 (8th Cir.1996). This ruling was distinguished in Cooley and Union Pacific, but has been relied on as a bar to PDA claims regarding prescription contraceptives in Cummins and Wright.\\n1017 *1017 The most thorough consideration of the differences between denying prescription contraceptives to women and men is found in Judge Smith Camp\\'s opinion in Union Pacific. There, in addition to the fact that there are no current prescription contraceptives for men, it was explained that contraception, in preventing paternity, has a major social significance for men but avoidance of pregnancy has both social and physical significance for women. The Circuit in Krauel noted the distinction by stating that \"potential pregnancy, unlike fertility, is a medical condition that is sexrelated because only women can become pregnant.\" 95 F.3d at 680.\\nIt seems worth mentioning that Judge Perry, in Wright, departed from her colleague\\'s ruling in Cooley, based on a rationale going back to Krauel. I am persuaded by Union Pacific, and conclude that we do have a sound Pregnancy Discrimination Act claim here, as well as a soundly alleged Title VII claim (a conclusion consistent with that of Judge Perry in Wright).[2]\\nII.\\nDefendant contends this entire case is time-barred because the denial of prescription contraceptives was contained in a collective bargaining agreement that it made in 1998, long before the charge was filed here in 2002, and plaintiff did not file a charge although she had notice of the particular restriction at least by January, 2000. AT & T seeks to distinguish the contrary ruling on timeliness in a very recent Eighth Circuit case where women firefighters successfully complained of being required to use specialized clothing designed for men and facilities discrimination that had a long history, but continued into the 300-day period before the charge was filed. Wedow v. City of Kansas City, 442 F.3d 661 (8th Cir.2006).\\n\\n\\x0cWedow accepts guidance from National Railroad Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 122 S.Ct. 2061, 153 L.Ed.2d 106 (2002), which greatly modifies pre-existing law regarding so-called continuing violations. The concept was severely restricted, being now only clearly available in hostile work environment cases. Morgan effectively preserves many claims previously rejected on timeliness grounds, but at the same time greatly restricts the period for which damages are available. See Bazemore v. Friday, 478 U.S. 385, 106 S.Ct. 3000, 92 L.Ed.2d 315 (1986), reaffirmed in Morgan and relied on in Wedow.\\nIt is clear, under Wedow, that timely claims can be filed where there are specifically discriminatory working conditions, benefits, wages and the like that may have had a long history but continue into the 300-day period for filing charges. Defendant\\'s principal argument to the contrary in this case is that it took no direct action during the immediate pre-charge period, such as issuing a discriminatory payroll check. But there was no requirement of recent direct action in Wedow. Other situations of discrimination occur that do not require current employer action. Continued inaction suffices in situations like this. One might also suggest that issuance of a discriminatory 1018 paycheck is not the wrong complained of, but rather the failure to *1018 make greater payments. That is essentially what occurred here.\\nPlaintiff bought and paid for prescription contraceptives on at least one occasion for which a timely charge could be filed. She sought no reimbursement from defendant or the insurance company in question. That would clearly have been a futile act, as defendant acknowledges. A claimant is generally not required to engage in a futile act to preserve a right. Failure to exhaust available remedies is not presented as a defense this case. The analogy to Wedow seems unmistakable, and I will deny defendant\\'s motion for summary judgment, except as to the damage period.\\nIII.\\nThe parties in their motions ask for different rulings on the period open to plaintiff (and her class, if certified). Defendant contends that plaintiff is time-barred from claiming expenses of prescription drugs incurred before the 300-day period allowed in Missouri for making charges of discrimination. Thus, she would have no claim for the time after she stopped using contraceptives and no claim for any uncompensated expenditures before October 31, 2001. Plaintiff argues that there was a continuing wrong during the entire period of the collective bargaining agreement.\\nI agree with defendant in its contention that remediable wrongs occurred from time to time when plaintiff made purchases under the discriminatory agreement, but only to the extent such purchases occurred within 300 days of filing the charge.\\nA recent application of the principle involved occurred in Wedow v. City of Kansas City, Mo., supra. In that case a jury found that women firefighters had been forced to use ill-fitting, cumbersome, and somewhat disabling and potentially dangerous clothing of the type suitable for and supplied to male firefighters. Plaintiffs had also been supplied discriminatory rest-room facilities. Although the discriminatory policies long pre-dated the filing of charges, the complainants were confined to damages occurring during the 300-day limitations period. The Court of Appeals found the claims \"akin to the line of cases stemming from Bazemore v. Friday, 478 U.S. 385, 395, 106 S.Ct. 3000, 92 L.Ed.2d 315 (1986)(holding that each week\\'s paycheck that delivers less on a discriminatory basis is a separate Title VII violation).\" 442 F.3d at 671. This has sometimes been referred to as a \"serial violation.\" The Court also relied on the most recent Supreme Court handling of the issue of \"continuing violations\". National Railroad Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, supra. In using hostile work environment claims as rare examples of continuing violations the Supreme Court emphasized how rarely the concept could be used to avoid the short limitation period created by Congress. Absent the narrow range of cases that fall within a \"continuing violation\" concept, the Supreme Court emphasized that a \"discrete . . . discriminatory act `occurred\\' on the day that it `happened\\'. A party, therefore, must file a charge within either 180 or 300 days of the date of the act or lose the ability to recover for it.\" 536 U.S. at 110, 122 S.Ct. 2061. (emphasis added). In rejecting further frequent use of the \"continuing violation\" theory, the Court referred to the EEOC\\'s advocacy of the concept of \"certain serial violations and systemic violations\" that would allow a longer period of recovery. The Court stated that such\\n\\n\\x0cinterpretive guidelines must yield to the Supreme Court\\'s role as a final authority. 536 U.S. at 110-1, n. 6, 122 S.Ct. 2061. Advocacy by plaintiff of these concepts after the Morgan decision is thus unsound.\\n1019 Plaintiff now acknowledges (Doc. 122) that Morgan eliminated the possibility *1019 of using serial violations to avoid the 300 day limitation on recoveries. She claims however, that \"systemic violations\" can still be used. In the previously quoted footnote, the Morgan opinion put both categories in the same basket. Moreover, the violation here, as in Wedow, was clearly of a serial nature, dependent on repeated purchases, even though \"systemic\" in the sense that employer policies of general application originated the discriminatory conduct. Where, as here, the violation of rights can be broken down into a series of discrete acts, a common source, through company-wide or \"systemic policy\", does not preserve old claims. See Davidson v. America Online, Inc., 337 F.3d 1179, 1184-6 (10th Cir.2003).\\nPlaintiff contends the continuing violation theory is still usable in post-Morgan cases involving discriminatory salary contentions and cites Tademe v. Saint Cloud State University, 328 F.3d 982, 989 (8th Cir.2003). That case uses Bazemore language, however, and notes that the claim of discrimination was timely because the charge was filed within 300 days of the last discriminatory pay-checks. There was no occasion to rule or comment on the question of a 300-day cutoff for damages because the Circuit sustained summary judgment for defendant on the merits. Thus Tademe cannot be cited as contrary to the result in Wedow.[3]\\nBeing unable to cite cases decided after Morgan in support of a contention that recovery can be had for events earlier than the 300 days allowed for filing charges, plaintiff falls back on a different statute of limitations than the one governing the filing of charges. Civil actions by a person aggrieved by employment discrimination may be filed under 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(f), which contains no periodic cutoff language for remedies. Another subsection relating to injunctions and equitable relief does contain the following: \"Back pay liability shall not accrue from a date more than two years prior to the filing of a charge with the Commission\". 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(g)(1). Plaintiff contends the statutory language in itself frees her from the restrictions advocated by defendant.\\nAs stated by the First Circuit some years before Morgan, \"By allowing for the possibility of recovering back pay for over a year prior to the 300 day filing period, `Congress must have envisioned continuing remediable violations that existed prior to the running of the period.\\'\" Sabree v. United Bhd. Of Carpenters and Joiners, 921 F.2d 396, 401 (1st Cir.1990). Even more compelling, as a pre-Morgan citation, is an opinion by Judge Loken for our Circuit. Ashley v. Boyle\\'s Famous Corned Beef Co., 66 F.3d 164 (8th Cir. en banc 1995). In that case, on allegations that gender discrimination tainted the plaintiff\\'s rate of pay, the Court ruled that \"relief back to the beginning of the limitations period strikes a reasonable balance between permitting redress of an ongoing wrong and imposing liability for conduct long past\" 66 F.3d at 168. A charge was filed in November, 1992 concerning a continuing pay discrimination practice dating back to 1986. It is my understanding of the opinion that it would allow back pay recovery to November, 1990.\\n1020 If there is conflicting language in Title VII, it seems clear that Morgan resolves *1020 the conflict in favor of the shortened recovery period, despite the oddity in drafting that affects remedial relief in injunction cases. While the parties and I do not find substantial appellate court discussion of the issue, the plain language of Justice Thomas in Morgan effectively \"eviscerates the continuing violation doctrine outside of hostile environment claims\", as contended by the successful defendant in Lewis v. Norfolk Southern Corp., 271 F.Supp.2d 807, 813 (E.D.Va.2003). If the Ashley \"reasonable balance\" is to be reinstated it will require legislation.\\nTherefore partial summary judgment will be entered in favor of defendant, limiting plaintiff\\'s remedy to uncompensated expenditures for prescription contraceptives subsequent to October 31, 2001.\\nIV.\\nHaving given up her earlier claim for injunctive relief, plaintiff now seek designation of a class of female employees of defendant seeking damages under Rule 23(b)(3), F.R.Civ.Proc. She needs a finding that questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for adjudication of the controversy. As in all class actions there must be satisfaction of the elements of Rule 23(a), which include numerosity making\\n\\n\\x0cjoinder impracticable, questions of law or fact in common, typicality of the claims of the plaintiff as proposed representative, and assurance to the court that plaintiff as a representative would fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.\\nPlaintiff\\'s deposition has been taken, with excerpts supplied to the court by counsel. During the course of litigation I have become somewhat familiar with the performance of counsel in this variety of litigation. Defendant basically questions the thoroughness of the record on the class action elements and seeks denial of a class action because members of the class would have so many individualized histories that it would allegedly be very burdensome to develop damage claims with any precision or uniformity.\\nStarting with plaintiff, her motivation is asserted to be the establishment of the rights of women employees of AT & T to nondiscrimination in health care benefits. While arguably much of this interest has become satisfied, as of July, 2002, I am not charged with appraising a claim of overzealous prosecution of litigation which might currently be categorized as an effort to obtain rather nominal damages for a previous violation of rights. The main thing for me to guard against is personal venality or an effort to use the class for personal benefit. That is not inferable and is not claimed by defendant.\\nCounsel are deemed to be skillful and experienced enough to serve as class counsel, and that is also not a subject of challenge by defendant.\\nIn light of the small damage claim available to each member of the class, it is realistically certain that only a class action could feasibly result in an adjudication of the rights here at stake. The superiority of a class action proceeding is the dominant factor in my determination.\\nDefendant challenges the showing of numerosity, but I can almost take judicial notice that this is not a serious issue. The basic question to be decided is whether I should require joinder rather than create a class, and that would only be a close question if we were dealing with several dozen or fewer prospective members of that class. That is the significance of numerosity. A distinction needs to be made between prospective class members and 1021 likely class members. I cannot predict with any confidence that more than several dozen *1021 individuals would choose to remain in the class, given the small stakes and the nuisance involved in reconstructing or remembering medical history enough to specify it under oath. But the question is whether an unmanageable number of persons are prospective members of the class. Compare Cox v. American Cast Iron Pipe Co., 784 F.2d 1546 (11th Cir.1986).\\nWith a very large company like AT & T I must assume a very considerable number of women of child-bearing age would be in non-management positions and would be using birth control, either by relying on a male partner or by themselves. The need for prescription contraceptives for many women would be a matter I can accept as a matter of judicial notice. Even if a large number of employees elected HMOs, where prescription contraceptives were available, it is fair to assume there are a significant number of individuals similarly situated with plaintiff. If the number throughout the country is at least 100-500 that would, in my judgment, be vastly more than would satisfy the numerosity requirement and it seems almost frivolous to question that such figures exist. While the burden is on plaintiff, defendant could doubtless make a good estimate and perhaps has done so. The question is less technical, and more susceptible to ruling as a matter of common knowledge, than the numerical issue in Yong Soon Oh v. AT & T Corp. 224 F.R.D. 357 (D.N.J.2004).\\nFor present purposes I accept numerosity. Common questions exist, and will define the class that would be created. Plaintiffs claims are clearly typical, except for her discontinuance of contraceptives mid-point in the 300 day period. This would create a problem of fairness in using this representative if the members of the class were thereby denied the right to claim damages through the month of June, 2002. Defendant suggests no authorities that would terminate the rights of members simply because plaintiff changed her practice. Members of the class, for better or worse, use their own experiences to establish damages. Members of the class, although personally dilatory in pursuing their $1 a day entitlement, are of course able to use plaintiffs charge to get them into court. Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 95 S.Ct. 2362, 45 L.Ed.2d 280 (1975). Although that may have given defendant the idea that claimants would be dependent on plaintiffs rights to damages I am satisfied this concept relates only to filing procedure. Because Albemarle allows class members to benefit from plaintiffs standing, plaintiff contends they should not be limited by residing in a state with a 180-day filing requirement.\\n\\n\\x0cThe weight of authority, however, seems to limit damages for class members living in non-deferral States to injury incurred during the 180 day period prior to filing of a charge on which those claimants can rely. See, e.g., Church v. Consolidated Freightways, Inc., 137 F.R.D. 294, 309-10 (N.D.Cal.1991) Although I am thus presently inclined to accept defendant\\'s contention as to the controlling time periods, that does not affect class certification or class description. The class description should be inclusive, in my judgment, for the sake of simplicity, with damage limitations for individual claimants to be determined later (if the parties consider that worth the trouble). Just as claimants who, like plaintiff, may have discontinued use of prescription contraceptives during the time-frame established by the charge, and may thus be restricted to a limitation on recoveries, those claimants living in the handful of non-deferral States would simply have a damage limitation imposed. In any event, defendant\\'s contention about non-deferral States would not affect class certification but would at most, favor use of a subclass.\\n1022 *1022 None of the issues mentioned in Rule 23(b)(3) or 23(a) create problems for creation of a class other than the one defendant emphasizes; that is, the many different histories that individuals in the class are likely to present. Even that issue is, in my judgment, nearly frivolous, in light of the very small sum of money anyone can claim, and the practical strictures that both sides will feel in pursuing and debating such differences. I cannot imagine defendant spending half a day of time in specific discovery or in challenging some individual claim. This might result in some vulnerability to false claims, which is also not an issue before me, but would probably be dealt with through sworn documents relating to claims.[4] The experience in the Union Pacific case, as evidenced in the opinions, confirms my view that the parties, in the interest of practicality, could probably agree on a settlement alternative for individuals that would likely dispose of the bulk of claims. Administrative proceedings have been devised in the railroad case that could simplify things here. Defendant does not adequately respond to that experience, except to say that it was initiated \"under a completely different class action standard.\" This has no bearing on the processing of damage claims. In other words, management of the class action should not predictably be very burden-some-unless one simply resents the expense of litigation.\\nA class will therefore be certified, with Susan Stocking as representative of the class.\\nIt is therefore ORDERED that plaintiff\\'s motion for summary judgment as to liability is GRANTED, defendant\\'s motion for summary judgment is DENIED, except that it is GRANTED in limiting damages to the period from October 31, 2001 to July 2, 2002, and plaintiff\\'s renewed motion for class certification is GRANTED.\\nThe parties are directed to negotiate a plan for further proceedings pursuant to these rulings and to propose an agreed order or series of specific orders within thirty days of this date.[5] If unable to agree plaintiff shall file her proposed order(s) on that day and defendant shall file objections and counter proposals within seven days there after. SO ORDERED.\\n[1] Years ago it was customary to disregard or devalue unpublished trial court decisions because almost anything can be out there, and there is suspicion that counsel will skew their disclosures to favor their clients-although suppression of adverse authority would be unethical. Published decisions continue to have more weight, in general, because they reflect the significance attached to them by the author.\\n[2] I acknowledge that conceptually the Title VII claims seems more obviously appropriate than the PDA claim, because the avoidance of pregnancy was somewhat outside the target area of the PDA. Union Pacific makes a persuasive showing, however, that the language of the Pregnancy Act can fairly be read to reach the current subject. The sufficiency of Title VII without the PDA amendment is accepted in Wright, but the problem there is with earlier Supreme Court cases. Unless and until the Circuit speaks differently, I accept Union Pacific on the PDA and Wright on Title VII. We likely will have an appellate ruling before this case is in final judgment.\\n[3] See another post-Morgan case where a claimant abandoned at oral argument her contention that she could recover in a discriminatory compensation case for a period outside the 300-day charge filing period. Hildebrandt v. Illinois Dept. of Natural Resources, 347 F.3d 1014, 1025 (7th Cir.2003). Taking another tack, plaintiff seeks to distinguish \"wage discrimination cases\" from this one. Reply Brief, Doc. 109, page 13, note 18. Such cases are, however, closer to this case than a hostile work environment case would be. Wedow is an example.\\n\\n\\x0c[4] A questionnaire can be worked out that would deal with all issues that might eliminate claims-such as contraceptive users for medical necessity (which was always covered by the program) rather than simply birth control.

Simpkins, Assistant U.S. Attorney-Fairview Heights, Fairview Heights, IL, for United States of America, Plaintiff.\\nOpinion\\n\\nORDER\\n\\nPROUD, United States Magistrate Judge.\\nBefore the Court is plaintiff Camillo’s motion to compel defendant Kenneth Hall Regional Hospital to produce documents in response to plaintiff’s requests for production Nos. 18 and 19, propounded on or about February 3, 2005. (Doc. 108). The documents at issue are billing and refund records which the hospital contends reveal confidential medical information of non-party patients. The hospital is willing to produce the records provided the records are subject to a protective order meeting the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) (see 45 C.F.R. § 164.512).1 (Doc. 121).\\n\\n1\\n\\nHIPAA protects “protected health information” from\\n\\ndisclosure. “Protected health information” means\\n\\nindividually identifiable health information that is\\n\\nmaintained and/or transmitted in any form or medium.\\n\\n45 C.F.R. § 160.103.\\n\\nThe protective order proposed by the hospital and rejected by plaintiff would redact virtually all identifying information, including addresses, all elements of dates except the year (including birth, admission and discharge dates), phone numbers, e-mail addresses, Social Security\\n\\nnumbers, account numbers, medical record numbers and health plan beneficiary numbers. (Doc. 121, Exhibit B, ¶ 5). The parties themselves are free to characterize documents as “confidential” or “confidential-counsel only.” (Doc. 121, Exhibit B, ¶ 3). “Confidential-counsel only” documents are not to be shown to plaintiff Anthony Camillo, although his counsel is permitted to view the materials. (Doc. 121, Exhibit B, ¶ 6(b)). If such documents are to be shown to consulting experts, an executed non-disclosure form identifying the expert must be presented to the hospital in advance. (Doc. 121, Exhibit B, ¶ 8).\\nPlaintiff contends that the aforementioned redactions would prevent cross-referencing other documents. Plaintiff notes that the parties agree that the documents will be used only for purposes of this litigation. Plaintiff also feels hamstrung by the “confidential- *522 counsel only” designation, which would preclude the relator himself, who is familiar with Medicare billing practices, from participating in this litigation. Plaintiff further objects to having to reveal experts whose identities may not be required to be revealed under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\\nThe hospital counters that Illinois law is stricter than HIPAA privacy provisions with respect to non-party patient information and do not permit disclosure of records in this situation, and that comity should compel adherence to the Illinois law. See 735 ILCS § 5/8-802 and 45 C.F.R. § 160.203(b). The redaction provisions are aimed at satisfying the Illinois law, not HIPAA. With respect to plaintiff’s need to cross-reference documents, the hospital contends that the issue in this case is alleged double-billing to medicare and nursing homes, which has nothing to do with individual patient accounts, so patient privacy should prevail. The hospital asserts that plaintiff/relator Camillo has a history of falsifying forms and forging signatures, which indicates great potential for misuse of protected information. Lastly, the hospital reasserts its initial objection to the relevance and scope of plaintiff’s request for production No. 18, regarding billing information.\\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(1) permits the discovery of any matter relevant to the subject matter of the pending action, so long as the sought after information is not privileged, even if inadmissible at trial, if the information sought appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. The Supreme Court has interpreted relevance broadly to include any matter that bears on, or that reasonably could lead to other matter that could bear on, any issue that is or may be in the case. Oppenheimer Fund, Inc. v. Sanders, 437 U.S. 340, 351, 98 S.Ct. 2380, 57 L.Ed.2d 253 (1978). Discovery may be had from any person, provided that the person from whom discovery is sought is not subjected to\\n1\\n\\n\\x0cU.S. ex rel. Camillo v. Ancilla Systems, Inc., 233 F.R.D. 520 (2005)\\n\\nannoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(c), 30(b), 34, and 45. Accordingly, in a situation such as this, the interests of the plaintiff and the non-party patients must be balanced.\\n[1] The Fifth Amended Complaint alleges that the defendant hospital and its parent company violated the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. 3729 et seq., by bundling chemical profile tests when billing nursing homes and unbundling those charges when billing Medicare, double billing in various manners, and submitting multiple and excessive bills. (Doc. 122). Although the hospital correctly observes that this action is not about individual patients, plaintiff obviously needs to be able to compare and cross-reference documents in order to pinpoint which bills and refunds support the alleged fraudulent activity. Because names, account numbers, etc., can be manipulated to conceal improper activities, plaintiff needs to be able to cross-reference multiple identifiers to identify which bills and refunds are properly the subject of this action. Therefore, the Court finds plaintiff’s requests for production Nos. 18 and 19 relevant\\n[2] [3] HIPAA permits protected health information to be revealed in response to a discovery request, if the parties agree to a protective order and have presented it to the Court, or have asked the Court for a protective order. 45 C.F.R. § 164.512(e)(1). The protective order should prohibit the use or disclosure of the protected health information for any purpose other than the litigation, and require the return or destruction of the protected health information (including all copies made) at the end of the litigation or proceeding. Id. The HIPAA provisions do not create a privilege against production or admission of evidence; they merely create a procedure for obtaining protected medical record in litigation. Northwestern Memorial Hospital v. Ashcroft, 362 F.3d 923, 925-926 (7th Cir.2004); see also Fed.R.Evid. 501. By all accounts, the parties agree to abide by the HIPAA requirements. However, the defendant hospital wants plaintiff to also comply with the more stringent requirements of Illinois law, which would not permit the disclosure of identifying information in this situation. See 735 ILCS 5/8-802.\\nThe Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit ruled in Northwestern Memorial Hospital v. Ashcroft that a more restrictive state law cannot be used in a federal-question *523 action such as this to hamstring the enforcement of federal law. 362 F.3d at 925. Because Illinois law would, at a minimum, redact the identifying information needed to analyze the hospital’s billing practices, any interest in comity must fall by the wayside. Accordingly, paragraph 5 of the protective order proposed by the hospital is unacceptable. (Doc. 121, Exhibit B, ¶ 5).\\n[4] Turning to the “confidential-counsel only” provision of the protective order proposed by the hospital (Doc. 121, Exhibit B, ¶ 6(b)), the Court first takes issue with the fact\\n\\nthat the hospital is given free rein to, in effect, characterize information as privileged or afforded additional protections. The determination of good cause cannot be left to the parties, that is the Court’s prerogative. Fed.R.Civ.P.26(c). Furthermore, the hospital has failed to show cause for restricting the plaintiff/relator’s access to the billing and refund documentation. Any fears of spoliation of evidence should be allayed by the very fact that the hospital remains in possession of the original records. There is absolutely no reason to believe that the plaintiff/relator will abuse the HIPAA-protected documents. Therefore, paragraph 6(b) of the protective order proposed by the hospital is entirely unacceptable. (Doc. 121, Exhibit B, ¶ 6(b)).\\n[5] The Court agrees that it is appropriate to have those permitted access to HIPAA-protected documents execute a non-disclosure form. However, the hospital has failed to show sufficient cause for requiring advance authorization from the hospital, especially insofar as plaintiff would be forced to reveal experts or consultants plaintiff would otherwise not be required to reveal. There is no reason not to trust plaintiff’s counsel to ensure that non-disclosure forms are executed and logged, and confidentiality maintained. Therefore, paragraph 8 of the protective order proposed by the hospital is unacceptable in the aforementioned respects. (Doc. 121, Exhibit B, ¶ 8).\\nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that, for the aforestated reasons, plaintiff Camillo’s motion to compel defendant Kenneth Hall Regional Hospital to produce documents in response to plaintiff’s requests for production Nos. 18 and 19, propounded on or about February 3, 2005, (Doc. 108) is GRANTED.\\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, on or before November 18, 2005, the parties shall execute a HIPAA qualified protective order in compliance with the rulings contained within this order; a motion for entry of said protective order shall be immediately filed and the executed protective order submitted to the Court at <cippd@ilsd.uscourts.gov> for final review and approval.\\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that defendant Kenneth Hall Regional Hospital shall have seven calendar days from the date the Court files the approved protective order to produce the requested HIPAA-protected documents to plaintiff.\\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\\nParallel Citations\\nMed & Med GD (CCH) P 301,767\\n\\t\\r \\xa0\\n2\\n\\n\\x0cU.S. ex rel.

SACHS, United States District Judge.\\n*1 This case concerns alleged sex discrimination in the employer’s denial of health care costs for prescription contraceptives (prior to a change in the program in 2002). It now comes back to me for reconsideration. The Court of Appeals has rejected the challenge to a similar program. In re Union Pacific Railroad Employment Practices Litigation, 479 F.3d 936 (2007). In partial reliance on the district court’s ruling in Union Pacific, I granted summary judgment to the plaintiff here and created a class for determination of compensation. Stocking v. AT & T Corporation, 436 F.Supp.2d 1014 (W.D.Mo.2006).\\nDefendant now moves for reconsideration. Doc. 151. Opposition has been filed (Doc. 153) and a reply has been received. Doc. 154. Both sides seek oral argument. Having concluded that defendant is clearly entitled to prevail, based on the appellate decision, it is not necessary to explore multiple issues posed by the parties or to hear argument.\\nPlaintiff now limits her contention to an issue of disparate\\n\\nimpact, not expressly discussed by the Court of Appeals. Because I conclude that was no discrimination, under the majority ruling above, the case falls in any event. Definition of the main issue seems controlling. If treated as a discrimination claim in compensating for prescription contraceptives, a form of health care exclusively used by women, plaintiff and her class would seem to have a sound case. If treated as a blanket denial of funding for all contraceptives, whether used by men or women, the discrimination case fails. The policy was facially neutral and neutral in fact. No one was repaid for such expenses. The majority of the panel characterized the question in the latter manner (479 F.3d at 943-5), and I necessarily adopt that view on remand. See also Krauel litigation discussion in the Reply Brief, pp 4-5, Doc. 154.1\\n\\n1\\n\\nI am not prepared to reopen litigation for some sort of\\n\\nstudy of male and female contraception expenses.\\n\\nI agree with the pertinent portions of defendant’s argument presented in Doc. 151.\\nIt may be useful to mention some reservations about portions of defendant’s briefing that may be a form of overkill. Defendant argues that, in any event, the claim made is out of time, under the current ruling by the Supreme Court in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co., 127 S.Ct. 2162 (2007). That case may not be pertinent to a disparate impact theory because turning on a conclusion that there was no showing or inference of discriminatory animus in the application of an earlier program to the plaintiff during the limited period before discrimination charges were filed. Since an impact case does not require discriminatory animus one doubts that Ledbetter can be invoked.\\nQuoting from an opinion by Judge (now Justice) Kennedy, defendant contends that disparate impact cases are confined to the “job selection process” and not to other issues such as benefits. AFSCME v. Washington, 770 F.2d 1401, 1406 (9th Cir.1985). In several other Circuits, but not the Eighth, this narrowing of impact relief has been cited. Judge Posner has observed that the denial of relief in comparable worth cases conflicts with the theory that disparate impact can be pursued in a logical manner to impose statutory liability. See, e.g. Davidson v. Board of Governors, 920 F.2d 441, 445-6 (7th Cir.1990). Because of inconsistency in theories, it would seem (without further sorting out of cases) that disparate impact might be confined to the “job selection process” or that the comparable worth cases could be confined to that issue-or some intermediate line-drawing could occur. I need not deal with that here.2\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\x0cStocking v. AT&T Corp., Not Reported in F.Supp.2d (2007)\\n\\n2\\n\\nI also need not deal with a contention in the Reply Brief\\n\\nthat disparate impact cases cannot produce\\n\\ncompensatory damages. Kolstad v. American Dental\\n\\nAssociation, 527 U.S. 526, 534 (1999).\\n\\n*2 Concluding that the opinion of the Court of Appeals, as applied here, requires a judgment for defendant, it is\\n\\nhereby ORDERED that judgment should be entered in favor of defendant and that the prior ruling in favor of plaintiff and her class (Doc. 126) is hereby vacated.\\n\\t\\r \\xa0\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\x0c', 'CLOSED, EAPADMIN, PHV\\nU.S. District Court United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri (Kansas City)\\nCIVIL DOCKET FOR CASE #: 4:03−cv−00421−HFS\\n\\nStocking et al v.

            "long summary: On January 23, 2004, Plaintiff filed an amended complaint under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq. and 2000e(k), against AT&T Corporation in the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri.  The plaintiff, represented by private counsel, was a former AT&T employee and asked the Court for declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as damages, alleging that AT&T's health insurance policy discriminated against women.  Specifically, the plaintiff contended that the defendant's health insurance plan, which did not provide prescription contraceptives (birth control) before 2002 and only through the mail after 2002, violated female employees' civil rights.\n",
            "\n",
            "The action originally started in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas, but was transferred to Missouri on May 12, 2003.  This is the date on which the docket begins.  Originally, there were two plaintiffs on the case, but one dropped out of the litigation.  Thus, a single plaintiff carried forth the case.\n",
            "\n",
            "On September 3, 2004, the Court (Judge Sachs) denied the plaintiff's motion for class certification.  In the opinion, the Court barely discussed the requirements for a class-action lawsuit, except to point out typicality.  The plaintiff, since the suit began, had stopped taking birth control and was seeking to get pregnant.  Therefore, the Court declared that a class could not be certified without a class representative who would have an ongoing interest in the prayed-for relief.  The plaintiff wanted to recover her past expenditures on the prescribed contraceptives.  The Women's Law project came onto the case as an amicus.  After a lengthy discovery period, the Court made another ruling.\n",
            "\n",
            "On June 7, 2006, the Court (Judge Sachs) granted the plaintiff's motion for class certification as to the damages in the complaint.  The class was comprised of female employees of AT&T, who paid for their own prescription contraception from the dates of October 31, 2001 to July 2, 2002.  The Court did not certify the claims for injunctive or declaratory relief because as of 2002, the health insurance provider covered birth control through mail order. While the cost of the plaintiff's potential recovery was relatively small, $68.07, the class action potential in the litigation, given AT&T's size made both parties fight vigorously.  According to the docket, neither side was content with this decision.  The plaintiff wanted the period of time for damages claims to be extended, and the defendant did not approve of the decision at all.  Ultimately, the plaintiffs filed an appeal.  \n",
            "\n",
            "On June 1, 2007, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit issued a preliminary judgment to the District Court (Judge Sachs).  The Circuit Court advised the District Court to review the findings of another recent case, In Re Union Pacific Railroad Employment Practices Litigation, 479 F.3d 936 (8th Cir. 2007).  This case featured a ruling that was fundamentally at odds with the decision of the District Court on June 7, 2006.\n",
            "\n",
            "On October 22, 2007, the District Court (Judge Sachs) vacated its previous decision, and ordered a decision in favor of the defendant.  The case was closed the next day on October 23, 2007.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "short summary: This case was brought in 2004 by a female former AT&T employee against AT&T Corp. in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri.  The plaintiff alleged that AT&T, specifically the company's health insurance policy, discriminated against women, and she sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as damages.  The Court originally denied the plaintiff's motion for class certification, but later reversed its denial and granted summary judgment to plaintiff, certifying a class to determine compensation.  However, the Court of Appeals referred the District Court Judge to a relevant case which rejected a challenge to a similar program, thereby forcing the Court to vacate its prior ruling and issue judgment in favor of defendants on October 22, 2007.\n",

The plaintiffs were elderly and/or disabled recipients of Medicaid who received daily twenty-four-hour split-shift in-home care through the New York State Medicaid program. The suit was filed against the Commissioner of the New York State Department of Health and the Executive Deputy Commissioner of the New York State of Temporary and Disability Assistance (the \\\"State Defendants\\\"), and against the Administrator of the New York City Human Resources Administration/Department of Social Services (the \\\"City Defendant\\\"). Plaintiffs brought the action under the Medicaid Act, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1396 et seq. and its implementing regulations; Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\\\"ADA\\\"), 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 12131 et seq. and its implementing regulations; Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (\\\"Section 504\\\"), 29 U.S.C. \\u00a7 794; and the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment and Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution. Plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief.\\n\\nThe City Defendant had notified members of the putative class that their home care service hours would be reduced, even though their current level of care was physician-prescribed and there had been no changes to their medical conditions or treatment needs, on the basis that the plaintiffs did not meet the \\\"total assistance\\\" requirement of Medicaid regulations. Plaintiffs argued that this policy was arbitrary and irrational, and that because there was not change in the plaintiffs' conditions, these reductions violated the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment. Plaintiffs argued that the defendants had discriminated against plaintiffs on the basis of disability and that they had put the plaintiffs at risk of unnecessary institutionalization, contrary to the integration and anti-discrimination and mandates of the ADA and Section 504. Plaintiffs also alleged the defendants had violated the Medicaid Act by denying Medicaid recipients a level of equal in amount, scope, and duration to that provided to other Medicaid recipients with the same medical needs.\\n\\nOn June 12, 2012, the parties agreed to a joint stipulation in lieu of temporary restraining order proceedings before the court, wherein the defendants agreed not to reduce the hours of any additional patients, with very limited exceptions, while the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction was pending before the Court.\\n\\nOn June 28, 2012, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that removed references to preliminary relief. On August 29, 2012, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed all claims against the Executive Deputy Commissioner. The Commissioner of the New York State Department of Health remained in the case.\\n\\nOn September 4, 2012, the Court (Judge Shira A. Scheindlin) granted the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction in part, preventing the defendants from reducing any patients care while the case was pending or until further decisions, except in cases where there were changes to a patient's condition that made the service reduction medically appropriate, as certified by a physician who had personally examined the patient. The Court declined to reinstate twenty-four-hour split-shift care for all those patients whose level of care had been reduced between October 4, 2011 and the date of the injunction. Strouchler v. Shah, 891 F. Supp. 2d 504 (S.D.N.Y. 2012). The Court denied the Defendants' motion to modify this preliminary injunction on September 12, 2012. \\n\\nOn October 5, 2012, the Court (Judge  Scheindlin) granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification, with the Court amending the definition as: \\\"[a]ll New York City Medicaid recipients of continuous personal care services who, at any time since January 1, 2011, have been threatened with unlawful reduction or discontinuance of these services or whose care has been unlawfully reduced or discontinued because the City Defendant has determined that they do not meet the medical criteria for these services.\\\" The Court explained that, because the preliminary injunction was in place, it was unnecessary to include the words \\\"or will be.\\\" Strouchler v. Shah, 286 F.R.D. 244 (S.D.N.Y. 2012).\\n\\nOn October 15, 2012, the parties filed a joint stipulation, with the defendants' agreeing to reinstate the split-shift care of an individual member of the purported class whose service had been reduced to sleep-in care prior to the date of the preliminary injunction. On November 12, 2012, in the wake of the Hurricane Sandy disaster, the Court ordered the defendants to restore split-shift care to 16 individuals identified by the plaintiffs. This order was modified by an order dated November 16, 2012, which referred to a state-level directive ordering the restoration of split-shift care to certain individuals already being served by a \\\"managed long-term care provider.\\\"\\n\\nThe parties then proceeded to the discovery phase of the litigation, while engaging in settlement negotiations. \\n\\nTwo years later, on May 27, 2014, the parties filed a settlement agreement, which was approved by Judge Scheindlin on September 12 of the same year. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, the State and City Defendants agreed that continuous personal care services of any Medicaid recipient thereof shall not be reduced or terminated for any of five reasons: \\\"the recipient needs only 'some' assistance;\\\" \\\"the recipient's needs can be predicted or scheduled;\\\" \\\"the recipient's only medical needs are turning and positioning;\\\" \\\"there has been a change in the recipient's medical condition, unless [the State or City] Defendant submits to the recipient a notice that identifies the change and states why the prior services are no longer needed;\\\" or \\\"there has been a mistake in the previous assessment, unless the [local district or City Defendant] submits to the recipient a notice that identifies the mistake and states why the prior services are not needed.\\\" The agreement further stipulates that the State Defendant is to make best efforts to amend state law such that it is consistent with the agreement under the New York State Administrative Procedure Act. In exchange, the plaintiffs released the City and State Defendants from all claims. The case was closed on September 16, 2014.\\n\",\n          \"On October 6, 2015, Prison Legal News (PLN) filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee (Knoxville) against the Knox County Sheriff\\u2019s Office. PLN sued under 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1983, alleging that the defendant violated their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights to freedom of speech, due process, and equal protection by unlawfully censoring the books, magazines, and other mail they sent to inmates at the Knox County Jail. PLN claimed that from November 2014 to October 6, 2015, the defendant refused to deliver all publications and enveloped mail sent by PLN to prisoners at Knox County Jail, which censored PLN\\u2019s correspondence with inmates at the jail on matters of public concern. PLN also claimed that the defendant  failed to inform them of the alleged violation of the jail's mail policy and depriving them of the opportunity to contest the decision. Represented by private counsel, PLN asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as compensatory and punitive damages. \\n\\nOn October 6, 2015, the plaintiffs filed a Motion for a Preliminary Injunction. \\n\\nOn February 3, 2016, Judge Thomas A Varlan granted the plaintiff\\u2019s motion to stay the action until March 31, 2016, which suspended court proceedings so that the parties could engage in mediation. All other pending motions, including the plaintiff's Oct. 6 Motion for a Preliminary Injunction, were denied with leave to refile upon lifting the stay. Mediation efforts were ultimately unsuccessful, and the plaintiff did not refile their motion.\\n\\nOn October 13, 2016, the defendants filed an amended answer in which they admitted liability on the plaintiff\\u2019s First and Fourteenth Amendment claims, stating that the jail had revised their inmate mail policy to remove the restrictions that formed the basis for PLN\\u2019s constitutional challenges.\\n\\nOn June 26, 2017, the parties filed a joint stipulation agreeing that: 1) PLN\\u2019s claims against the defendants should be dismissed, and 2) PLN sustained $25,000 in compensatory damages as a result of the defendant\\u2019s unconstitutional practices and should be awarded that amount. They also agreed that these two stipulations resolved all issues in the case except for the plaintiff\\u2019s entitlement to injunctive relief, attorney\\u2019s fees, and costs. \\n\\nThe plaintiff moved for a permanent injunction to prevent the defendant from resuming their unconstitutional practices in the future. The defendant argued that their voluntary cessation of unconstitutional conduct was genuine and that returning to their old practices would be an irrational waste of county resources, given the cost of litigation. The court ruled in favor of the defendant, holding that the issue of injunctive relief was moot because the defendant carried its burden of showing it would not readopt its unconstitutional mail policy in the future. \\n\\nThe court noted that its denial of the plaintiff\\u2019s motion for permanent injunction did not close the case because the parties had yet to file motions concerning the plaintiff\\u2019s entitlement to attorney\\u2019s fees, the only remaining issue of the case. \\n\\nThe parties settled as to attorneys fees on April 4, 2018. The amount they settle for is private. The case is now closed. \",\n          \"On December 9, 2013, a United States citizen of Latino national origin filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.  The plaintiff, represented by the Legal Aid Society Employment Law Center, brought this complaint under Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1983, and state law against the state of California. He sought monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief, claiming employment discrimination in violation of the Due Process Clauses and Equal Protection Clauses of the United States Constitution and California State Constiuttion, national origin discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and National Origin and Ancestry Discrimination in Violation of\\nCalifornia Fair Employment and Housing Act. The case was assigned to Judge William Alsup.\\n\\nSpecifically, the plaintiff had applied for a job as a Correctional Officer with the California Department of Corrections in 2011.  He claimed that he was unlawfully removed from consideration because he reported in a background questionnaire that prior to becoming a permanent resident and then citizen of the United States, he used a social security number that was not his own to obtain work. Plaintiff paid all required taxes using an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) until he obtained his own social security number. He was reportedly removed from consideration because his use of a fake social security number was deemed to \\\"show a lack of honesty, integrity and good judgment.\\\" A similar series of events occurred when plaintiff reapplied for the same position in 2013. \\n\\nThe state responded that questions about the use of a false social security number were necessary to conduct a thorough background investigation of candidates.  The state also asserted that there was no Title VII violation because the plaintiff's claim rested on immigration status and not national origin, and because the hiring statistics indicated that there was no discriminatory effect on Latino hiring at the California Department of Corrections.  \\n\\nOn May 7, 2014, the District Court (Judge William Alsup) dismissed plaintiff's Section 1983 equal protection and substantive due process claims, as well as the Title VII claim against the State Personnel Board, but denied motions to dismiss the Title VII claim against the California Department of Corrections and procedural due process claim. The District Court dismissed all state law claims without prejudice. 2014 WL 1867067.\\n\\nOn July 17, 2015, the District Court denied without prejudice the plaintiff's motion for leave to amend, and directed plaintiff to engage in further discovery prior to his final opportunity to move to amend his equal protection claims and Title VII claim against the State Personnel Board. The court granted him leave on October 29, 2014. 2014 WL 5474950. The plaintiff filed his third and final amend complaint the same day.\\n\\nOn March 12, 2015, the state filed another motion for summary judgment. On July 21, the court granted the plaintiff\\u2019s Title VII claims, holding that asking applicants whether they had ever used a fake social security number had a disparate impact on Latinos. The court dismissed the plaintiffs' equal protection claim. 119 F.Supp.3d 1065. The court issued a final order as to relief on September 28, 2015. This order held that the plaintiff should be allowed to finish the hiring process. If he was able to successfully pass background investigation and complete the training academy, he would be awarded $140,362 in backpay. The plaintiff was also granted attorneys\\u2019 fees. 2015 WL 5681029.\\n\\nOn October 6, 2015, the state appealed the judgment to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\\n\\nOn October 30, 2015, the plaintiff moved for the award of his attorneys\\u2019 fees. The parties disagreed about how much in attorneys\\u2019 fees would be appropriate, so the court decided that a third party should decide the amount. 2015 WL 7423229. On January 28, 2016, the court appointed a special master to make this determination. The special master decided that the state owed the plaintiff $1,237,024.82 in fees and costs, and the court approved this amount on June 16, 2016. 2016 WL 3360638.\\n\\nFour days later, the state appealed the order granting attorneys\\u2019 fees to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. (Its first appeal had not yet been ruled on.) On May 16, 2017, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court\\u2019s judgment as to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation but reversed the judgment as to the State Personnel Board because the Personnel Board was not part of the hiring process and had no say in the questions on the job application. 701 Fed.Appx. 613. The case was remanded to the District Court to reassess damages against one state defendant rather than two. 2017 WL 6270383.\\n\\nOn January 30, the parties filed a stipulation in the Ninth Circuit stating that they resolved the attorneys\\u2019 fees dispute informally, outside of court. In light of this stipulation, the Ninth Circuit dismissed all pending motions as moot on March 27, 2018.\\n\\nThere are no further entries in the docket since March 2018.

The Plaintiffs suit were elderly and/or disabled recipients of Medicaid who received daily twenty-four-hour split-shift in-home care, without which they would not have been able to live in their own homes in the general community. The suit was filed against New York City and State health officials. The Defendants had notified members of the putative class that their home care service hours would be reduced, even though there had been no changes to their medical conditions or treatment needs. Plaintiffs argued these reductions violated the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment, the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, the Medicaid Act, and prior court orders. On September 4, 2012, the Court granted in part the Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, preventing the Defendants from reducing patients from split-shift care to a lower level of care while the case was pending, with some exceptions. On November 12, 2012, in the wake of the Hurricane Sandy disaster, the Court ordered the Defendants to restore split-shift care to 16 individuals identified by the Plaintiffs. On May 27, 2014, the parties filed a settlement agreement, which was approved by the Court on September 12 of that year. Under the agreement, the defendants agreed not to terminate or reduce personal care to Medicaid recipients for a variety of reasons.

COLE, in her official capacity\\n\\nas CABELL COUNTY CLERK, and VERA .T. MCCORMICK, in her official capacity as\\n\\nKANAWHA COlJNTY CLERK, and allege as follows:\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\n\\n1. Plaintiffs are six lesbian and gay West Virginians who comprise three loving and\\n\\ncommitted same-sex couples (\"adult Plaintiffs\" or \"Plaintiff couples\"), and a child of one of the\\n\\ncouples (\"child Plaintiff\\') (collectively, \"all Plaintiffs\"). All Plaintiffs bring this action pursuant\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:13-cv-24068 Document 8 Filed 10/01/13 Page 2 of 30 PageID #: 17\\nto 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to challenge Defendants\\' discriminatory denial to the Plaintiff couples ofthe freedom to marry in the State of West Virginia (\"the State\"), and Defendants\\' exclusion of the child Plaintiff from belonging to a family headed by married parents, solely because the members of each of the Plaintiff couples are of the same sex. All Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief for the violation of their guarantees of liberty and equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution as a result of West Virginia statutes that expressly deny same-sex couples, including Plaintiff couples, the fre.edom to marry and also deny respect to marriages of same-sex couples validly entered in other states, see W.Va. Code §§ 48-2-104, 48-2-401, and 48-2-603 (collectively hereinafter the \"marriage ban\" or \"the ban\").\\n2. The adult Plaintiffs seek the freedom to marry the one unique and irreplaceable person each loves, and thereby to assume the responsibilities and obtain the myriad protections, obligations and benefits conferred upon married couples and upon their children under state and federal law. Plaintiff A.S.M. seeks the protections, security, support, and benefits conferred upon the children of married parents, and to end the stigma, shame, and humiliation imposed upon children of lesbian and gay parents by the law\\'s refusal to permit them to belong to families with married parents and designation of their families as inferior to others and unworthy of marnage.\\n3. The right to marry the person of one\\'s choice, and to direct the course of one\\'s life in this intimate realm without undue government interference is one of the fundamental liberty interests protected for all by the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution. The State\\'s exclusion of plaintiff couples and other same-sex couples from marriage violates their fundamental right to marry. The State also interferes with the constitutionally protected liberty and privacy interests in familial association and integrity of A.S.M. and other similarly-\\n2\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:13-cv-24068 Document 8 Filed 10/01/13 Page 3 of 30 PageID #: 18\\nsituated children of same-sex couples without any compelling, important or even legitimate justification.\\n4. The State also has deprived all Plaintiffs of their guarantee of equality under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution by denying Plaintiff couples and other lesbian and gay West Virginians the right to marry the person of their choice based solely on their sexual orientation and sex. Likewise, the State denies the child Plaintiff and other children of same-sex parents equal access to the dignity, legitimacy, protections, benefits, support, and security conferred on children of married parents under state and federal law.\\n5. Marriage plays a umque role in society as the universally recognized and celebrated hallmark of a couple\\'s commitment to build family life together. It confers upon couples a dignity and status of immense import. Through the marriage ban and through Defendants\\' enforcement of the ban, the State and Defendants send a purposeful message that they view lesbians, gay men, and their children as second-class citizens who are undeserving of the legal sanction, respect, protections, and support that different-sex couples and their children receive automatically through marriage.\\n6. The marriage ban inflicts serious and irreparable harms upon the adult Plaintiffs and the child Plaintiff and other san1e-sex couples and their children across the State. The ban excludes them from the security and support available to married couples and their children, and from the myriad legal protections available to spouses and their children under state and federal law.\\n7. The marriage ban penalizes the adult Plaintiffs\\' self-determination in the most intimate sphere of their lives. The Supreme Court has stated that marriage is the most important\\n3\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:13-cv-24068 Document 8 Filed 10/01/13 Page 4 of 30 PageID #: 19\\nrelation in life, as well as an expression of emotional support and public commitment and a farreaching legal acknowledgement of the intimate relationship between two people. The marriage ban deprives the adult Plaintiffs and other same-sex couples of dignity, and humiliates plaintiff A.S.M. and other children of same-sex couples, by branding their families as inferior and unworthy of the legitimacy, recognition, and respect accorded to other frunilies.\\n8. Because the freedom to marry is one of the vital personal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men and women, Plaintiffs seek equal access to the ±i-eedom to marry for same-sex couples as the only means to secure their rights to due process and equal protection of the law, and to eliminate the myriad serious harms inflicted on all Plaintiffs by the marriage ban and Defendants\\' enforcement of it.\\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE 9. All Plaintiffs bring this action under 42 U.S.C §§ 1983 and 1988 to redress the deprivation under color of state law of rights secured by the United States Constitution. 10. This Court has original jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343 because the matters in controversy arise under the Constitution and laws of the United States. 11. Venue is proper in this Court under 28 U.S.C § 139l(b) because all Defendants reside within the Southern District and State of West Virginia, and the events that gave rise to all Plaintiffs\\' claims took place within the Southern District of West Virginia. Further, a majority of the parties, namely, Plaintiffs Casie Jo McGee (\"Casie\"), Sarah Elizabeth Adkins (\"Sarah\"), Justin Murdock (\"Justin\"), and William Glavaris (\"Will), and Defendant Karen S. Cole reside within the Huntington Division of the Southern District of West Virginia, and a substantial part of the events that gave rise to all Plaintiffs\\' claims took place within the Huntington Division.\\n4\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:13-cv-24068 Document 8 Filed 10/01/13 Page 5 of 30 PageID #: 20\\n12. This Court has the authority to enter a declaratory judgment and to provide preliminary and permanent injunctive relief pursuant to Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202.\\n13. This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendants because they are domiciled in the State.\\nPARTIES A. Plaintiffs 14. Plaintiffs CASIE, 30, and SARAH, 32, are a lesbian couple living in Huntington, Cabell County, within the Huntington Division of the Southern District of West Virginia. Casie and Sarah have been in a loving committed relationship for more than 3 years and wish to marry. Both life-long West-Virginians, Casie was raised in Ritchie County, West Virginia and is currently an Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Mountwest Community and Technical College in Huntington. She obtained her bachelor\\'s degree in English and Mathematics and her master\\'s degrees in Mathematics from Marshall University. Sarah has lived all her life in Cabell and Wayne Counties, West Virginia, and is currently an anthropology student at Marshall University. The marriage ban frustrates Casie\\'s and Sarah\\'s dreams of being able to marry each other before their friends and families in West Virginia. Additionally, the marriage ban strains the couple\\'s finances and causes them to feel stress and uncertainty about the future. For example, if they were able to marry, Casie, a public employee, would be able to provide Sarah with spousal health insurance coverage on her employer-provided health plan. Because the couple is barred from marrying, Casie cannot add Sarah to her plan. Casie and Sarah cannot afford to buy separate health insurance for Sarah, who has diabetes. In the past, Sarah required treatment at an emergency room for elevated blood sugar. Because Sarah had no health insurance, she and Casie were required to pay for the services out of pocket. As well, Casie and\\n5\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:13-cv-24068 Document 8 Filed 10/01/13 Page 6 of 30 PageID #: 21\\nSarah are planning to create a family together through the use of assisted reproductive technology (\"ART\") and an anonymous sperm donor, and look forward to the day when they will have children. However, Casie\\'s inability to put Sarah on her health insurance affects the couple\\'s plans for bringing children into their family. For couples like Casie and Sarah who are exploring ART, the decision about who will carry the child is a complicated consideration of health issues, employment issues, and finances. Both Casie and Sarah have significant health concerns they must take into account before deciding to get pregnant. However, because Sarah cannot get health insurance as Casie\\'s spouse, the possibility of Sarah carrying their child has been completely talcen off the table. In this way, the denial of marriage to Casie and Sarah directly impacts the couple\\'s private, intimate decision about how to bring children into their lives. Casie and Sarah wish to marry in order to safeguard their relationship to each other and to protect any children they may have.\\n15. Plaintiffs JUSTIN, 32, and WILL, 31, are a gay couple living in Huntington, Cabell County, within the Huntington Division of the Southern District of West Virginia. Justin and Will have been in a loving committed relationship for over two (2) years and wish to marry. Justin, who grew up in Wayne County, West Virginia, works for his family\\'s business, which supplies physically disabled persons with mobility products and home and vehicle modifications. Will grew up in Logan County, West Virginia, and moved to Huntington to become a student at Marshall University. Will is a network engineer. Justin has two children from a prior marriage he entered into before he had acknowledged to himself or to others that he is a gay man, and he now shares custody of his children with his former spouse. When Justin and Will first met a few months after Justin\\'s divorce becan1e final, they each knew that there was something special about the other. On one of their first dates, Justin took Will to church with him to meet his\\n6\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:13-cv-24068 Document 8 Filed 10/01/13 Page 7 of 30 PageID #: 22\\nfriends and local community. Last year, Justin asked Will to marry him and their friends cheered as Will said yes.\\n16. Plaintiffs NANCY, 43, and JANE, 45, are a lesbian couple living together with their six year-old son, Plaintiff A.S.M., in St. Albans, Kanawha County, West Virginia. Nancy and Jane have been in a loving committed relationship for 16 years and wish to marry. Nancy and Jane own an information technology consulting business together. Nancy was born in St. Albans, graduated from Marshall University, and has lived in the area for most of her life. Ja~e is a native of Oklahoma but relocated to St. Albans a number of years ago after she and Nancy decided to conceive a child. The couple conceived A.S.M. by assisted reproductive technology with an anonymous donor. Nancy and Jane decided to raise A.S.M. in St. Albans because they wanted to be near friends and family and because it was a community that they knew and loved. Nancy and Jane wish to marry both because they love each other, and for the sake of A.S.M. Although Jane has functioned as A.S.M.\\'s parent in every way since his birth, she is not A.S.M.\\'s legal parent, and only Nancy is listed on A.S.M.\\'s birth certificate. Jane and Nancy worry that in an emergency, Jane will not be recognized as A.S.M.\\'s parent or even family member, or otherwise as a person authorized to make medical decisions for him. Because Jane and Nancy have been unable to secure their family relationships through marriage, they have paid for alternate, but inadequate and inferior protections such as powers of attorney for health care and paperwork to make Jane a legal guardian to A.S.M. Jane and Nancy must remember to carry important legal documents wherever they go. Jane and Nancy also me concerned about the dignitary harm that A.S.M. may suffer from the couple\\'s inability to marry, especially now that he already tmderstands that West Virginia law relegates them to being, in his words, \"just partners,\" and bars them from being a family with married parents. Nancy and Jane fear that he\\n7\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:13-cv-24068 Document 8 Filed 10/01/13 Page 8 of 30 PageID #: 23\\nwill internalize the message he receives from his government that his family is not as worthy as other families and that he and his parents do not deserve the support for their relationships that other children and their parents receive. Additionally, because West Virginia law bars Nancy and Jane from marrying, Nancy and Jane lack the financial safety net available to manied couples and their children. For example, because Nancy and Jane can neither get nor be recognized as married, Nancy and A.S.M. are not eligible to receive Jane\\'s social security survivor benefits or the retirement benefits that Jane anticipates receiving from her former employer that would be available to Jane\\'s legal spouse and child.\\n17. Plaintiff A. S.M., 6, sues through his parents and next friends NANCY ELIZABETH MICHAEL and JANE LOUISE FENTON. Nancy and Jane bring this action on behalf of A.S.M. because he is harmed by his parents\\' inability legally to marry. Because the State does not allow Nancy and Jane to marry, A. S.M. does not have the benefit of the rights, obligations, cost savings, and other benefits that accrue to the benefit of children of married parents under West Virginia law, nor of the rights and status conferred on children of married parents by West Virginia law that help and provide security to other West Virginia children in good times and bad. For example, the guardianship documents that the couple drew up to provide some limited protection to Jane\\'s relationship to A.S.M. terminate upon his reaching adulthood, were costly, and Jane and Nancy would have preferred to put that money toward other child-centered expenses; A.S.M. is harmed by his and his parents lack of access to laws that establish and protect the parentage of children of married couples. A.S.M. also faces less dignity and legitimacy, in his own eyes, the eyes of many others and under law, from his parents not having the freedom to marry one another.\\n8\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:13-cv-24068 Document 8 Filed 10/01/13 Page 9 of 30 PageID #: 24\\nB.

Both of the Defendants, and those subject to their supcrvtswn, direction, and control, intentionally performed, participated in, aided and/or abetted in some manner the acts alleged herein, proximately caused the harm alleged herein, and will continue to injure Plaintiffs irreparably if not enjoined.\\n9\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:13-cv-24068 Document 8 Filed 10/01/13 Page 10 of 30 PageID #: 25\\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS A. Adult Plaintiffs Attempted to Marry But Were Prevented From Doing So. 21. But for the fact that they are of the same sex, each Plaintiff couple is legally qualified to marry under the laws of West Virginia and wishes to marry in the State. Each adult Plaintiff is over the age of 18, and no adult Plaintiff is precluded from marriage as a result of having another spouse or being closely related to his or her life partner. 22. On or about September 18, 2013, Casie McGee and Sarah Adkins appeared in person at the office of Defendant Cole in Huntington, West Virginia, to seek a marriage license because they wish to marry each other. They both presented valid forms of identification, provided the required personal information, and were prepared to pay the required fee and complete a marriage application. When the couple requested a marriage license, an employee of Defendant Cole answered, \"We can\\'t do it because you\\'re both female.\" Casie and Sarah accordingly were denied the opportunity to obtain a marriage license by Defendant Cole\\'s office based solely on West Virginia\\'s prohibition on marriage for same-sex couples and Plaintiffs\\' respective sex and sexual orientation. 23. On or about September 24, 2013, Justin Murdock and William Glavaris appeared in person at the office of Defendant Cole in Huntington, Cabell County, West Virginia, to seek a marriage license because they wish to marry each other. They both were prepared to present valid forms of identification, provide the required personal information, pay the required fee, and complete a marriage application. When Justin and Will requested a marriage license, an employee of Defendant Cole refused and handed them a copy of a letter prohibiting clerks from issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Justin and Will accordingly were denied the opportunity to obtain a marriage license by Defendant Cole\\'s office based solely on West\\n10\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:13-cv-24068 Document 8 Filed 10/01/13 Page 11 of 30 PageID #: 26\\nVirginia\\'s prohibition on marriage for same-sex couples and Plaintiffs\\' respective sex and sexual orientation.\\n24. On or about September 19, 2013, Nancy Michael and Jane Fenton appeared in person at the office of Defendant McCormick in Charleston, Kanawha County, West Virginia, to seek a maniage license because they wish to marry each other. They both were prepared to present valid forms of identification, provide the required personal information, pay the required fee, and complete a marriage application. When the couple requested a marriage license, an employee of Defendant McCormick asked, \"Where\\'s your groom?\" Nancy and Jane explained that they wished to many each other. The employee responded, \"That\\'s not recognized in the State of West Virginia. There\\'s nothing we can do here.\" Nancy and Jane accordingly were denied the opportunity to obtain a marriage license by Defendant McCormick\\'s office based solely on West Virginia\\'s prohibition on marriage for same-sex couples and Plaintiffs\\' respective sex and sexual orientation.\\nB. West Virginia\\'s Marriage Ban Singles Out Same-Sex Couples and Excludes Them From Marriage.\\n25. West Virginia has enacted statutes that exclude same-sex couples from marriage. See W.Va. Code§§ 48-2-104 and 48-2-401. These statutes cannot be explained by reference to legitimate public policies that could justify the disadvantages the marriage bans impose on samesex couples who wish to marry. Rather, the history of these enactments and their own text demonstrate that interference with the equal dignity of same-sex couples was more than a mere side effect of the various enactments - it was their essence.\\n26. Additionally, Defendants are authorized to record marriages entered by differentsex spouses in other jurisdictions when one or both of the spouses is a West Virginia resident, and the State regularly respects these out-of-state marriages as valid and legitimate under West\\n11\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:13-cv-24068 Document 8 Filed 10/01/13 Page 12 of 30 PageID #: 27\\nVirginia law. The State refuses, however, to recognize marriages entered by same-sex spouses in other jurisdictions. See W.Va. Code § 48-2-603. Thus, not only are the adult Plaintiffs and other same-sex couples denied the freedom to marry in West Virginia, but they are also denied the ability to have a valid marriage from another jurisdiction recorded or recognized in West Virginia.\\nC. All Plaintiffs Are Injured By The Marriage Ban. 27. Barring same-sex couples from marriage disqualifies them from critically important rights and responsibilities under state law that different-sex couples rely upon to secure their commitment to each other, and to safeguard their families. By way of example only, same-sex couples are denied:\\na. The benefit of the presumption that both spouses are parents to a child born during the marriage, including the automatic listing of the mother\\'s spouse as a parent on a child\\'s birth certificate, and the ability of a couple to confer legitimacy on their children by marrying;\\nb. A streamlined and relatively inexpensive process for bringing children into the family through adoption, whether through joint adoption, or for one spouse to adopt another\\'s child through a step-parent adoption;\\nc. Fan1ily health insurance coverage including spousal health benefits, and retirement benefits, and surviving spouse annuity benef1ts for public employees;\\nd. Family leave for a public employee to care for a spouse; e. Death benefits for surviving spouses of firefighters, law enforcement,\\nmilitary members, and emergency medical services persom1el who die in the\\n12\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:13-cv-24068 Document 8 Filed 10/01/13 Page 13 of 30 PageID #: 28\\nline of duty, and additional death benefits to a surviving spouse for each dependent child; f. The ability to safeguard family resources under an array of laws that protect spousal finances, including for example, tax laws including different state tax rates for married individuals, the right to file jointly to reduce tax liability, spousal tax exemptions including exemptions for surviving spouses, and tax benefits when transferring or inheriting interests in real and personal property; the benefit of a homestead exemption and personal property exemption for a spouse\\'s medical equipment, clothing, and other personal items; an exemption for a portion of a deceased spouse\\'s personal estate from the deceased\\'s debts or liabilities; the ability to file for workers compensation benefits on behalf of an incapacitated spouse and for the surviving spouse of a workers compensation beneficiary to receive compensation; and the ability for a spouse to receive unemployment compensation for a deceased claimant; g. The ability to make caretaking decisions for one another in times of death and serious illness, including priority to make medical decisions for an incapacitated spouse, the ability to authorize an autopsy, the automatic right to make burial decisions and other decisions concerning disposition and handling of remains of deceased spouses. h. The right to inheritance under the laws of intestacy and the right of a surviving spouse to an elective share; 1. Tuition fee waivers to the spouses and dependent children of employees of public universities;\\n13\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:13-cv-24068 Document 8 Filed 10/01/13 Page 14 of 30 PageID #: 29\\nJ. Benefits for spouses and dependent children of members of the military and veterans;\\nk. In the event that a couple separates, access to an orderly dissolution process Lor terminating the relationship, assuring an equitable division of the couple\\'s assets and debts, and adjudication of issues relating to custody, visitation, and support with respect to any children the couple may have.\\n28. The marriage ban not only denies all Plaintiffs and other same-sex couples and their children access to protections, benefits, rights, and responsibilities afforded to married persons and their children under state law, it also denies them eligibility for a host of federal rights and responsibilities that span the entire United States Code and federal regulations. Unmarried couples are denied recognition for virtually all purposes throughout the more than 1,000 statutes and numerous federal regulations relating to marriage, including laws pertaining to Social Security, housing, taxes, criminal sanctions, copyright, and veterans\\' benefits. Couples validly married in another jurisdiction and living in West Virginia may qualify for some federal benefits and protections, but the language of certain statutes and regulations, such as veterans\\' spousal benefits and Social Security survivor benefits, references couples recognized as married under the law of their state of residence or domicile. Many of these deprivations drain family economic resources, causing financial harm not only to same-sex couples but to their children as well.\\n29. In addition to causing the tangible harms listed above, all Plaintiffs are denied the unique social recognition that marriage conveys. Without access to the familiar language and legal label of marriage, the Plaintiff couples are unable instantly or adequately to communicate to others the depth and permanence of their commitment, or to obtain respect for that\\n14\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:13-cv-24068 Document 8 Filed 10/01/13 Page 15 of 30 PageID #: 30\\ncommitment as others do simply by invoking their married status. Likewise, without access to the familiar language and legal label of marriage, Plaintiff A.S.M. is unable instantly or adequately to communicate to others the depth and permanence of his parents\\' commitment, or to obtain respect for that commitment as others do simply by invoking their parents\\' married status.\\n30. Although the Plaintiff couples are all in committed relationships, they and other same-sex couples are denied the stabilizing effects of marriage, which helps keep couples together during times of crisis or conf1ict.\\n31. The substantive and dignitary inequities imposed on committed same-sex couples include particular harms for same-sex couples\\' children, who are equally deserving of the stability, permanence, and legitimacy that children of different-sex spouses enjoy. The marriage ban denies children of same-sex couples, including Plaintiff A.S.M., the dignity, legitimacy, rights, benefits, support, security, and obligations conferred on children whose parents are married. Plaintiff A.S.M. and other children of same-sex couples must combat the common assumption, reinforced by West Virginia law, that as members of a family headed by an unmarried couple their bonds are impermanent, insubstantial, and unworthy of equal dignity and legitimacy because the couple has not made a marital commitment and taken on the obligations of marriage. Civil marriage affords official sanctuary to the family unit, offering parents and children a familiar and public means of demonstrating to third parties a legal basis for the parentchild relationship. By denying same-sex couples access to marriage, the State reinforces the view held by some that the family bonds that tie same-sex parents and their children are less consequential, enduring, and meaningful than those of different-sex parents and their children. Plaintiff A.S.M.\\'s parents, Nancy and Jane, and other same-sex parents raising children in West\\n15\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:13-cv-24068 Document 8 Filed 10/01/13 Page 16 of 30 PageID #: 31\\nVirginia, cannot invoke their status as married in order to communicate to their own children and others the depth and permanence of the parents\\' commitment to each other in terms that society, and even young children, readily understand. Consequently, Plaintiff A.S.M. and other children of same-sex couples are left to grow up with the message that their parents and families are inferior to others and that they and their parents do not deserve the same societal recognition and respect.\\n32. Because same-sex parents and their children thus are deprived of the family security that inheres in a ready and familiar method of communicating to others the significance and permanence of their familial relationships, they must live with the vulnerability and stress int1icted by the ever-present possibility that others may question their familial relationships-in social, educational, and medical settings and in moments of crisis-in a way that spouses and their children can avoid by simple reference to being married.\\n33. Plaintiff A.S.M. and other children of same-sex couples are less legally secure and economically situated than children whose parents are able to marry, including because of expenses incurred in attempting to create legal protections that approximate some of those that are automatic through marriage, which protections are far inferior to the legal protections afforded through marriage, and because their families are denied the strengthening effect that marriage can provide to their parents\\' relationships.\\n34. Children from a young age understand that marriage signifies an enduring family unit, and likewise understand when the State has deemed a class of families as less worthy than other families, undeserving of marriage, and not entitled to the same societal recognition and support as other families. The State has no adequate interest to justify marking the children of\\n16\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:13-cv-24068 Document 8 Filed 10/01/13 Page 17 of 30 PageID #: 32\\nsame-sex couples, including plaintiff A.S.M ., with a badge of inferiority that invites disrespect in school, on the playground, and in every other sphere of their lives.\\n35. The government is a powerful teacher of discrimination to others. By decreeing that the relationships of same-sex couples must be ignored in West Virginia and enforcing that policy, the State and Defendants inform all persons with whom same-sex couples interact, including those couples\\' own children, that their relationships are less worthy than others. Bearing the imprimatur of the government, the State\\'s marriage ban, which relegates same-sex couples and their children to a lesser status, encourages others to follow the government\\'s example in discriminating against them.\\n36. The State\\'s marriage ban, and Defendants\\' enforcement of it, causes many private entities such as banks, insurers, and even health clubs, to likewise define \"family\" for purposes of an array of benefits and protections in ways that exclude same-sex couples and their children from important safety nets such as private employer-provided health insurance for family members. The State also encourages disrespect of committed same-sex couples and their children, including Plaintiffs, by others in workplaces, schools, businesses, and other major arenas of life, in ways that would be less likely to occur and more readily corrected if marriage were available to same-sex couples.\\nD. The Marriage Ban Is Not Even Rationally Related to a Legitimate Government Purpose, Let Alone Substantially Related To An Important Government Purpose Or Narrowly Tailored To A Compelling Governmental Purpose.\\n37. No legitimate, let alone impmiant or compelling, interest exists to exclude samesex couples from marriage. An individual\\'s capacity to establish a loving and enduring relationship does not depend upon sexual orientation or his or her sex in relation to his or her committed life partner, nor is there even any legitimate interest in preventing same-sex couples\\n17\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:13-cv-24068 Document 8 Filed 10/01/13 Page 18 of 30 PageID #: 33\\nand their children from belonging to families headed by a married couple, or in denying them the spousal protections marriage provides.\\n38. Neither history nor tradition can justify the marriage ban. Marriage has remained a vital and enduring institution despite undergoing significant changes over time to meet changing social and ethical needs, including by the elimination of many former requirements of marriage that we now recognize as discriminatory or otherwise impermissible -- such as racebased entry requirements, and gendered restrictions -- that historically were considered integral aspects of marriage. West Virginia is not confined to historic notions of equality, and no excuse for the State\\'s discriminatory restriction can be found in the pedigree of such discrimination.\\n39. The Supreme Court has made clear that the law cannot, directly or indirectly, give effect to private biases and expressly rejected moral disapproval of lesbian and gay relationships as a legitimate justification for a law.\\n40. Excluding same-sex couples from marriage does nothing to protect or enhance the rights of different-sex couples. Different-sex couples will continue to enjoy the same rights and status conferred by marriage regardless of whether same-sex couples may marry.\\n4 l. Although the State has a valid interest in protecting the public fiscally, it may not pursue that interest by making invidious distinctions between classes of its citizens without adequate justit1cation. Moreover, the State has no fiscal justification here for denying same-sex couples the freedom to marry because the State would generate additional revenues by allowing same-sex couples to marry, and be recognized as married.\\n42. The State\\'s interest in child welfare is affirmatively harmed rather than furthered by the marriage ban. The marriage ban injures same-sex couples\\' children without offering any benefit to other children.\\n18\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:13-cv-24068 Document 8 Filed 10/01/13 Page 19 of 30 PageID #: 34\\n43. Barring same-sex couples from marriage does not prevent same-sex couples from raising children together. Same-sex couples in West Virginia can and do bear children through use of reproductive technology that is available to same-sex couples and different-sex couples alike, and bring children into their families through foster care and adoption. Procreation is not a requirement of marriage, and many married people choose not to have children, while many unmarried people procreate. West Virginia has never restricted marriage to those capable of or intending to procreate, nor would it be constitutionally permissible to do so.\\n44. There is no valid basis for the State to assert a preference for parenting by different-sex couples over same-sex couples. Based on more than 30 years of research, the scientific community has reached consensus that children raised by same-sex couples are just as well-adjusted as children raised by different-sex couples. This consensus has been recognized by every major professional organization dedicated to children\\'s health and welfare including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Psychological Association, the American Medical Association, the National Association of Social Workers, and the Child Welfare League of America.\\n45. Other courts have found, after trials involving expe11 testimony, that there is not even a rational basis for favoring parenting by heterosexual couples over gay and lesbian couples. See, e.g., Perry v. Schwarzenegger, 704 F. Supp.2d 921, 980 (N.D. Cal. 201 0) (finding that the research supporting the conclusion that \"[c]hildren raised by gay or lesbian parents are as likely as children raised by heterosexual parents to be healthy, successful and well-adjusted\" is \"accepted beyond serious debate in the field of developmental psychology\"), aff\\'d sub nom, Perry v.

Howard, 238 S.W.3d 1 (Ark. 2006).\\n46. Excluding same-sex couples from marriage harms their children, including by branding their families as inferior and less deserving of respect, and by encouraging private bias and discrimination. Denying same-sex couples the equal dignity and status of marriage humiliates the children now being raised by same-sex couples, and makes it more difficult for the children to understand the integrity and closeness of their own family and its concord with other families in their community and in their daily lives.\\n47. Excluding same-sex couples from civil marriage will not make the children of different-sex spouses more secure. Different-sex spouses\\' children will continue to enjoy the benefits that flow from their parents\\' marriage, regardless of whether same-sex couples are permitted to marry. The marriage ban has no effect on the choices different-sex couples make about such profound issues as whether to marry, whether to have children, or whether to raise their children within marriage.\\n20\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:13-cv-24068 Document 8 Filed 10/01/13 Page 21 of 30 PageID #: 36\\n48. The State\\'s interest in the welfare of children parented by same-sex couples is as great as its interest in the welfare of any other children. The family security that comes from the State\\'s official recognition and support is no less important for same-sex parents and their children than it is for different-sex parents and their children.\\n49. Excluding same-sex couples from marriage does nothing to protect or enhance the rights of different-sex spouses. Different-sex spouses will continue to enjoy the same rights and status conferred by marriage regardless of whether same-sex couples may marry, unimpaired by the acknowledgment that this freedom belongs equally to lesbians and gay men.\\nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF COUNT I:\\nDeprivation of Due Process U.S. Const.

The right to marry the unique and irreplaceable person of one\\'s choice and to direct the course of one\\'s life in this intimate realm without undue government restriction is one of the f\\'tmdarnental liberty interests protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

W.Va.

Defendants\\' actions to enforce the marriage ban directly and impermissibly infringe on the adult Plaintiffs\\' choice of whom to marry, interfering with a core, life-altering and intimate personal choice.\\n55. The Due Process Clause also protects choices central to personal dignity and autonomy, including each individual\\'s rights to family integrity and association. Defendants\\' actions to enforce the marriage ban directly and impermissibly infringe adult Plaintiffs\\' deeply intimate, personal, and private decisions regarding family life, and preclude all Plaintiffs from obtaining full libe11y, dignity, and security for themselves, their families, and their parent-child bonds.\\n56. As the Cabell and Kanawha County clerks, Defendants Cole\\'s and McCormick\\'s duties and actions to ensure compliance with West Virginia\\'s discriminatory marriage ban by, for example, denying same-sex couples marriage licenses, violate adult Plaintiffs\\' fundamental right to marry, and the rights protected under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, to liberty, dignity, autonomy, family integrity, association, and due process of all Plaintiffs.\\n57. Defendants cannot satisfy the Due Process Clause\\'s decree that government\\'s denial of a fundamental right or substantial infringement of a liberty interest may be sustained only upon a showing that the burden is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling or even important governmental interest, as the marriage ban is not even tailored to further any legitimate interest at all.\\n22\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:13-cv-24068 Document 8 Filed 10/01/13 Page 23 of 30 PageID #: 38\\n58.

All Plaintiffs state this cause of action against Defendants 111 their official capacities for purposes of seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.\\n61. The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, enforceable pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, provides that no state shall \"deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" U.S. Canst. Amend. XIV, § 1.\\n62. W.Va. Code §§ 48-2-104, 48-2A01, and 48~2~603 and all other sources of West Virginia law that preclude marriage for same-sex couples or prevent recognition of marriages violate the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment both facially and as applied to Plaintiffs.\\n63. As the Cabell and Kanawha County clerks, Defendants Cole\\'s and McCormick\\'s duties and actions to ensure compliance with West Virginia\\'s discriminatory marriage ban by, for example, denying same-sex couples marriage licenses, violates the right of Plaintiffs to equal protection by discriminating impermissibly on the basis of the adult Plaintiffs\\' sexual orientation and sex, and impermissibly classifying the children of same-sex couples, including Plaintiff A.S.M., on the basis of their parents\\' sex, sexual orientation and marital status, and by\\n23\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:13-cv-24068 Document 8 Filed 10/01/13 Page 24 of 30 PageID #: 39\\ndiscriminating against all Plaintiffs in the enjoyment of equal liberties and equal exercise of fundamental rights.\\n64. Same~sex couples such as the Plaintiff couples are identical to different~sex couples in all of the characteristics relevant to marriage.\\n65. Same-sex couples make the same commitment to one another as different-sex couples. Like different-sex couples, same-sex couples fall in love, build their lives together, plan their futures together, and hope to grow old together. Like different-sex couples, same-sex couples support one another emotionally and financially and take care of one another physically when faced with injury or illness. Plaintiff couples seek to marry for the same emotional, romantic, and dignitary reasons and to provide the same legal shelter to their families, as different-sex spouses.\\n66. Like some different-sex couples, some same-sex couples are parents rmsmg children together.\\n67. Plaintiffs are equally worthy of the tangible rights and responsibilities, as well as the respect, dignity, and legitimacy that access to marriage confers on dit1erent-sex couples and their children. For the many children being raised by same-sex couples, including Plaintiff A.S.M., the tangible resources and societal esteem that access to marriage confers is no less precious than for children of different-sex couples.\\n68. Discrimination Based on Sexual Orientation. The marriage ban targets lesbian and gay West Virginians as a class for exclusion from marriage and discriminates against each adult Plaintiff based on his or her sexual orientation, both facially and as applied, and against A.S.M. based on the sexual orientation ofhis parents, both facially and as applied.\\n24\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:13-cv-24068 Document 8 Filed 10/01/13 Page 25 of 30 PageID #: 40\\n69. The exclusion of Plaintiffs from families headed by married couples based on the adult Plaintiffs\\' sexual orientation subjects Defendants\\' conduct to strict or at least heightened scrutiny, which Defendants\\' conduct cannot withstand because the exclusion does not even serve any legitimate governmental interests, let alone any important or compelling interests, nor does it serve any such interests in an adequately tailored manner.\\n70. Lesbians and gay men have suffered a long and painful history of discrimination in West Virginia and the United States.\\n71. Sexual orientation bears no relation to an individual\\'s ability to contribute to society.\\n72. Sexual orientation is a core, defining trait that is so fundamental to one\\'s identity and conscience that a person may not legitimately be required to abandon it (even if that were possible) as a condition of equal treatment.\\n73. Sexual orientation generally is fixed at an early age and highly resistant to change through intervention. No credible evidence supports the notion that such interventions are either effective or safe; indeed, they often are harmful and damaging. No mainstream mental health professional organization approves interventions that attempt to change sexual orientation, and virtually all of them have adopted policy statements cautioning professionals and the public about these treatments.\\n74. Lesbians and gay men are a discrete and insular minority, and ongoing prejudice against them continues seriously to curtail the operation of those political processes that might ordinarily be relied upon to protect minorities. Gay people have fewer civil rights protections at the state and federal level than racial minorities and women had when race- and sex-based classifications were declared to be suspect and quasi-suspect, respectively.\\n25\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:13-cv-24068 Document 8 Filed 10/01/13 Page 26 of 30 PageID #: 41\\n75. Lesbians and gay men lack express statutory protection against discrimination in employment, public accommodations, and housing at the federal level and in more than half the states, including West Virginia; are systematically underrepresented in federal, state, and local democratic bodies; have been stripped of the right to marry through 30 state constitutional amendments and are currently not permitted to marry in a total of 37 states; and have been targeted across the nation through the voter initiative process more than any other group.\\n76. Discrimination Based on Sex. West Virginia\\'s marriage ban discriminates against adult Plaintiffs on the basis of their sex, both facially and as applied, barring adult Plaintiffs from marriage or from being recognized as validly married, solely because each of the adult Plaintiffs wishes to marry a life partner of the same sex. The marriage ban discriminates against Plaintiff A.S.M. based on the sex of his parents, both facially and as applied. The sexbased restriction is plain on the face of West Virginia\\'s laws, which restrict marriage to \"union[s] between a woman and a man,\" W.Va. Code§ 48-2-104, and prohibit recognition of marriages in other states \"between persons of the same sex,\" W.Va. Code§ 48-2-603.\\n77. Because of these sex-based classifications, Casie, for example, is precluded from marrying Sarah because Casie is a woman and not a man; were Casie a man, she could marry Sarah.\\n78. West Virginia\\'s marriage ban also impermissibly enforces conformity with sex stereotypes by excluding adult Plaintiffs from marrying the one person each Plaintiff loves, because Plaintiffs have failed to conform to the sex-based stereotypes that men should many women, and that women should marry men.\\n79. The exclusion of adult Plaintiffs from marnage based on their sex, and the marriage ban\\'s requirement that adult Plaintiffs behave in conformity with sex-based stereotypes\\n26\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:13-cv-24068 Document 8 Filed 10/01/13 Page 27 of 30 PageID #: 42\\nas a condition of being able to many, cannot survive the heightened scrutiny required for sexbased classifications.\\n80. Discrimination Based on Parental Status. The mamage ban impermissibly classifies children, including Plaintiff A.S.M., on the basis of their parents\\' sex, sexual orientation and marital status, denying such children, including Plaintiff A.S.M., the dignity, legitimacy, security, support and protections available to children whose parents can marry. The State\\'s differential treatment of children based upon their parents\\' status cannot survive the heightened scrutiny required for classifications based on parental status.\\n81 . Discrimination With Respect to Fundamental Rights and Liberty Interests Secured by the Due Process Clause. The marriage ban discriminates against adult Plaintiffs based on sexual orientation and sex with respect to access to the fundamental right to marry, and against all Plaintiffs with respect to their liberty interests in dignity, autonomy, and family integrity and association. Differential treatment with respect to exercise of fundamental rights and liberty interests subjects Defendants\\' conduct to strict or at least heightened scrutiny, which Defendants\\' conduct cannot withstand.\\nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIKF COUNT III:\\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rules 57 and 65 (28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202)\\n82. All Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege all of the preceding paragraphs of this Complaint as though fully set forth herein.\\n83. This case presents an actual controversy because Defendants\\' present and ongoing denial of equal treatment and liberty to all Plaintiffs subjects them to serious and immediate harms, warranting the issuance of a declaratory judgment.\\n27\\n\\n\\x0cCase 3:13-cv-24068 Document 8 Filed 10/01/13 Page 28 of 30 PageID #: 43\\n84. All Plaintiffs seek preliminary and/or permanent injunctive relief to protect their constitutional rights and avoid the injuries described above. A favorable decision enjoining Defendants would redress and prevent the irreparable injuries to Plaintiffs identified herein, for which Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law or in equity.\\n85. The State will incur little to no burden in allowing same-sex couples to marry, whereas the hardship for all Plaintiffs of being denied equal protection and liberty is severe, subjecting them to an irreparable denial of their constitutional rights. The balance of hardships thus tips strongly in favor of all Plaintiffs.\\nJ>RAYER FOR RELIEF WHEREFORE, all Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court enter judgment: A. Declaring that the provisions and enforcement by Defendants of W.Va. Code §§ 48-2- I 04, 48-2-401, and 48-2-603 and any other sources of West Virginia law that exclude same-sex couples from marriage or from recognition of marriages entered into in another jurisdiction violate all Plaintiffs\\' rights under the Due Process Clause and Equal Protection Clause of the Fomieenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; B. Pennanently enjoining enforcement by Defendants of W.Va. Code §§ 48-2-104, 48-2-401, and 48-2-603 and any other sources of state law that exclude same-sex couples from marriage or refuse recognition to the marriages of same-sex couples entered into in another jurisdiction; C.

            " 'HUNTING\\n\\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF WEST VIRGINIA\\nTON DIVISION\\n\\nCASIE JO MCGEE and SARAH ELIZABETH ADKINS; JUSTIN MURDOCK and WILLIAM GLAVARIS; and NANCY ELIZABETH MICHAEL and JANE LOUISE FENTON, individually and as next friends of A.S.M., minor child,\\n\\nPlaintiffs,\\n\\nv.\\n\\nCIVIL\\n\\nKAREN S. COLE, in her official capacity as CABELL COUNTY CLERK; and VERA J. MCCORMICK, in her official capacity as KANAWHA COUNTY CLERK,\\n\\nDefendants, and\\n\\nSTATE OF WEST VIRGINIA\\n\\nIntervenor\\n\\nDefendant.\\n\\nACTION NO. 3:13-24068\\n\\nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER\\n\\nThis case is one of m any pro ceeding through the federal courts to ch allenge same-sex\\n\\nmarriage bans in the wake of the Un ited States Supreme Court decision in Windsor, decided just\\n\\nover one year ago. As nearly every decided case has concluded that the marriage bans violate the\\n\\nfundamental right of individuals to marry, the pace of this litigation accelerated dramatically in the\\n\\npast few months and culminated with the Supreme Court’s denial of appeals from federal circuit\\n\\ncourt decisions finding these marriage bans\\n\\nunconstitutional. This Court explicitly\\n\\nacknowledged the likely binding resu lt of the case which arose in th is Circuit, discussed in m ore\\n\\n\\x0cdetail below, and stayed the proceedings here pending its resolution. Now, that binding precedent and the acceptance by key state and county officials of its effect provide a clear blueprint for this Court’s ruling.\\nThe right to m arry is a funda mental right , giving every individual the opportunity to exercise choice in this important relationship. As such, the government must not interfere in that choice un less it d emonstrates com pelling state inte rests an d carefully tailor s its re strictions to protect thos e intere sts. W hile some m ay continue to hold a re ligious or m oral o bjection to same-sex marriage, governmental restrictions on individual rights must be justified by more than simply strongly, or even widely, held opinions ortraditions. Use of government power to prohibit the exercise of the right to marry fails to meet this test.\\nFor the reasons stated below, Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 40) is GRANTED. Defendant Vera J. McCorm ick’s Moti on to Dism iss (ECF No. 26), Defendant Karen S. Cole’s Motio n to Dism iss (ECF No. 31), Defendants’ Joint Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 62), the State of West Virginia’s Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 66), and the State of W est Virginia’s Motion to Dism iss (ECF No. 85) are DENIED. The State of W est Virgin ia’s Motion to Continue Me rits Stay and to Cale ndar Oral Argum ent on Threshold Issues (ECF No. 126) is DENIED in part and DENIED AS MOOT in part . Plaintiff’s Cross-Motion to Lift Stay and Enter Judgment (ECF No. 127) is DENIED AS MOOT. Plaintiff’s Motion and Amended Motion to Lift Stay and Enter Judgment (ECF No. 131, ECF No. 132) are GRANTED\\nI. Statement of Facts Plaintiffs in this case s eek declaratory reli ef o verturning West Vi rginia Code Sections 48-2-104 and 48-2-401, as well as “any other sources of West Virginia law that exclude same-sex\\n-2-\\n\\n\\x0ccouples from marriage” (collectively called the “marriage ban”). ECF No. 8. Plaintiffs also seek an injunction prohibiting Defendant Clerks from enforcing the marriage ban.\\nWest Virginia Code Section 48-2-104 li sts the requirem ents for m arriage license applications. Among other requirements, “[t]he application for a marriage license must contain a statement of the f ull nam es of both the f emale and the male parties” and “ must contain the following statement: ‘Marriage is designed to be a loving and lifelong union between a woman and a m an.’” W. Va. Code § 48- 2-104(a) & (c) (2012). Secti on 48-2-401 governs persons authorized to perform marriages and states in part, “Celebration or solemnization of a m arriage means the perform ance of the formal act or cerem ony by which a m an and woman contract marriage and assume the status of husband and wife.” W. Va. Code § 48-2-401 (2001).\\nPlaintiffs are six gay and le sbian West Virginians, com prising three sam e-sex adult couples: Casie Jo McGee and Sarah Elizabeth Adkins; Justin Murdock and William Glavaris; and Nancy Elizabeth Michael and Jane Louise Fenton, and A.S.M., the minor child of Ms. Michael and Ms. Fenton. Plaintiffs brought this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against Karen S. Cole, in her official capacity as Cabell C ounty Clerk, and Vera J. McCorm ick, in her official capacity as Kanawha County Clerk. ECF No. 8. Defendant Clerks are responsible for issuing m arriage licenses and recording marriages that take place in jurisdictions outside of West Virginia. Their responsibilities include ensuring that m arriage licenses and r ecords comply with West Virginia law, including the m arriage ban. Each of the same-sex couples sought a m arriage license from one of the defendant clerks, and each was initially denied. Plaintiffs contend that Defendants are violating Plaintiffs’ due processrights and equal protection rights,as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Since the filing of the pending motions, the State of West Virginia ( “the State”) has directed cou nty clerks to issue m arriage licenses to sam e-sex\\n-3-\\n\\n\\x0ccouples. ECF No. 134. West Virginia’s m arriage ban, however, rem ains in place. Plaintiffs accordingly request th at this Cou rt declare the m arriage ban unconstitu tional a nd enjoin enforcement of the marriage ban by Defendant Clerks.\\nThe State intervened as a defendant, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2403(b) and Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 5.1(c) and 24(a), to defend the constitutionality of the marriage ban. ECF No. 25.\\nThe defendant clerks each filed a motion to dismiss. This Court addressed their motions in part in a previous order, but reserved ruling on their motions as to the second prong of Burford abstention. ECF No. 56. The State has also file d a motion to dismiss. Plaintiffs, Defendants, and the State have each filed a motion for summary judgment. The State has also filed a motion to stay and to schedule oral ar gument on the th reshold issu es in this ca se, to which Plaintif fs responded with a cross-m otion to lift the stay and enter judgment. Plaintiffs later filed another motion and an amended motion to lift the stay and enter judgment.\\nIn Section II, the Court discu sses the State’s motion to dismiss and the clerks’ respective motions to dismiss. Section III addresses the parties’ motions for summary judgm ent. Section IV briefly examines the State’s m otion to stay a nd schedule oral argum ent, as well as Plaintiff’s responsive cross-m otion. Finally, Section V di scusses Plaintiffs’ most recent m otion and amended motion to lift the stay and enter judgment.\\nII. Motions to Dismiss A. Legal Standard A motion to dism iss pur suant to Rule 12(b)(1 ) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure raises the fundamental question of whether a court is competent to hear and adjudicate the claims brought before it. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1). It is axiomatic that a court must have subject matter jurisdiction over a controversy before it can render any decision on the merits. Adkins v. United\\n-4-\\n\\n\\x0cStates, 923 F. Supp. 2d 853, 856 (S.D. W . Va. 2013). If a Court does not have subject m atter jurisdiction over a case, the case must be dismissed. See id.\\nChallenges to jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1) may be raised in two distinct ways: “facial attacks” and “factual attacks.” Thigpen v. United States, 800 F.2d 393, 401 n.15 (4th Cir.1986), rejected on other grounds, Sheridan v. United States , 487 U.S. 392 (1988). A “facial attack” questions whether the allegations in the complaint are sufficient to sustain the court’s jurisdiction. Id. If a “facial attack” is made, the court must accept the allegations in the complaint as true and decide if the complaint is sufficient to confer subject matter jurisdiction. Id.\\nOn the other hand, a “factual attack” challenges the truthfulness of thefactual allegations in the complaint upon which subject matter jurisdiction isbased. In this situation, a “district court is to regard th e pleadings’ allegations as m ere evidence on th e issue, and may consider eviden ce outside the plead ings without converting the proceed ing to one fo r summ ary judgm ent.” Richmond, Fredericksburg & Potomac R.R. Co. v. United States, 945 F.2d 765, 768 (4th Cir.1991) (citing Adams v. Bain, 697 F.2d 1213, 1219 (4th Cir. 1982); Trentacosta v. Frontier Pac. Aircraft Indus., 813 F.2d 1553, 1558 (9th Cir.1987)).\\nB. The State’s Motion to Dismiss Here, the State’s motion to dismiss raises a facial attack. The State argues that Plaintiffs do not have Article III standing, and therefore this Court does not have jurisdiction, because Plaintiffs have failed to sue the defendants to whom their injury can be properly traced. ECF No. 86. Under Article III o f the United States Cons titution, a plaintiff has standing only if she can demonstrate that her “injury is ‘fairly traceable’ to the actions of the defendant, and that the injury will likely be redressed by a f avorable decision.” Bennett v. Spear , 520 U.S. 154, 162 (1997) (quoting Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992)). Although an injury is not\\n-5-\\n\\n\\x0cfairly traceable to th e defendant if it is cau sed exclusively by the acts of some third party, “that does not exclude injury produced by determinative or coercive effect upon the action of someone else.” Id. at 169. The party invoking the court’s juri sdiction bears the burden of establishing standing. Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561.\\nThe State maintains that Plaintiffs do not have standing because they did not sue the State Registrar and Secretary of State. ECF No. 86. The State Registrar is exclusively responsible for creating marriage license applications and, the Stat e claims, is therefore the only offi cial tasked with carrying out West Virginia Code § 48-2-104. ECF No. 86. Likewise, the Secretary of State is solely responsible for determining which religious celebrants may solemnize marriages in West Virginia. ECF No. 86. County clerks, the S tate explains, are only res ponsible f or accepting applications for marriage licenses and issuing those licenses. ECF No. 86.\\nPlaintiffs here chose to sue the cou nty clerks o f Cabell and Kanawha counties b ecause those clerks refused to issue marriage licenses to the same-sex couple plaintiffs. ECF No. 8. A marriage license is necessary to legally m arry under the laws of West Virg inia. W . Va. Code. § 48-2-101 (2001). By refusing to issue licenses, the clerks themselves directly took action which the plaintiffs claim violated their rights under the F ourteenth Am endment. ECF No. 8. The denial of marriage licenses is the p recise injury for which the plaintiffs seek redress in this cas e. ECF No. 8. Plaintiffs do not s eek an injunc tion requ iring the Sta te Registr ar to change th e marriage forms in West Virginia, nor do they seek to compel the Secretary of State to change the manner in which religious celebrants are authorized to perform marriages in the State. ECF No. 8. W hat the plaintiffs request is an injunc tion requiring the county cl erks to issue m arriage licenses to same-sex couples. ECF No. 8. This is an act that can be taken by the county clerks, as they are the officials responsible for issuing licenses in their respective counties. See ECF No.\\n-6-\\n\\n\\x0c86. Furthermore, this is an act that will directly redress the injury complained of in this case, that\\n\\nis, the denial of marriage licenses to same-sex couples. See ECF No. 8. See Bostic v. Shaefer,\\n\\n760 F.3d 352, 371 (4th Cir. 2014) (“[L]icense de\\n\\nnial constitutes an injury f or standing\\n\\npurposes . . . [Plaintiffs] can trace this den ial to [ Clerk’s] enf orcement of the alleged ly\\n\\nunconstitutional Virginia Marriage Laws, and declaring those laws unconstitutional and enjoining\\n\\ntheir enforcement would redress [Plaintiffs’] injuries.”).\\n\\nThe State Registrar m ay be the only official au thorized to alter West Virginia’s marriage\\n\\nforms, but other courts have afforded injunctive relief requiring officials to interpret existing laws\\n\\nand forms in a way that is const itutional, rather than requiring the officials to physically change\\n\\ntheir contents. See Califano v. Westcott , 443 U.S. 76, 89-90 (1979) (affi rming district court’s\\n\\ndecision to extend federal benefits statute to cov er previously excluded class be cause statute, as\\n\\noriginally enacted, violated equal protection clauses); Griego v. Oliver, 316 P.3d 865, 889 (N.M.\\n\\n2013) (“[In] New Mexico statutes, rules, regulati ons, or the common la w, whenever reference is\\n\\nmade to m arriage, husband, wife, spouse, fa mily, imm ediate fam ily, dependent, next of kin,\\n\\nwidow, widower or any other word, which, in cont ext, denotes a m arital relationship, the sam e\\n\\nshall apply to same-gender couples who choose to marry.”). Clearly, the Court here can direct the\\n\\ndefendants to issue marriage licenses without directing the State Registrar to issue different forms.\\n\\nLikewise, the plaintiffs here do not challenge theSecretary of State’s decisions regarding religious\\n\\ncelebrants. Rather, th ey challeng e the enti re ban on sam e-sex m arriage. ECF No. 8.\\n\\nAccordingly, these parties are not necessary to afford the plaintiffs injunctive relief.\\n\\nMoreover, the State has not dem onstrated that it is nec essary to join eith er the State\\n\\nRegistrar or the Secretary of Stat e in order to award declaratory re lief. The State maintains that\\n\\nthe doctrine of sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment bars declaratory relief in this\\n\\n-7-\\n\\n\\x0ccase. ECF No. 86. Sovereign immunity protects the State from direct suit and f rom actions\\nseeking retrospective, monetary relief. See Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 676 (1974). Here,\\nthe plaintiffs did not bring direct action against the State, nor do they seek monetary or injunctive\\nrelief against the State. Instead, the State chose to intervene in this action specifically to defend\\nthe constitutionality of West Virginia’s marriage ban. By intervening to protect this interest, the State is sub ject to any decla ration by th is Cou rt th at th e ban is unco nstitutional.1 Even if\\nsovereign immunity does shield the State from the immediate effect of the Court’s d eclaration,\\nPlaintiffs’ injury here is directly traceable to the defendants and the Court can thu s afford the\\nplaintiffs f ull re lief with respe ct to Def endant Clerks. See Bennett , 520 U.S. at 162.\\nAccordingly, Plaintiffs have standing and this Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this case.\\nC. Defendants’ Motions to Dismiss\\nDefendant Clerks have each filed a motion to dismiss. ECF No. 26; ECF No. 31. They\\nalso raise a facial attack, arguing that the Court should abstain from exercising jurisdiction in this\\ncase under the Burford abstention doctrine. As the Defendants’ arguments substantially overlap,\\nthe Court will address their motions to dismiss together.\\n1 The State’s Eleventh Amendment defense may also fail under the exception to state sovereign immunity recognized in Ex Parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908). Under Ex Parte Young, a plaintiff may challenge a state law as unconstitutional by suing a state oficial responsible for administering and enforcing that law. See Ex Parte Young, 209 U.S. at 155-56. Although the defendants here are county, rather than state, officials, they may be proper defendants in an Ex Parte Young suit. In Bostic, the Fourth Circuit held that a county clerk was a proper defendant underEx Parte Young because the clerk had “the requisite connection to the enforcement of the Virginia Marriage Laws due to his role in granting and denyingapplications for marriage licenses.” Bostic, 60 F.3d at 371 n. 3; see also Griffin v. Cnty. Scho ol Bd. of Prince Edward Cnty. , 377 U.S. 218, 228 (1964) (acknowledging that “suits against state and county officials” to enjoin unconstitutional action are permitted under Ex Parte Young ). Here, Defendant Clerks are th e officials directly responsible for effectuating the marriage ban and causing Plaintiffs’ alleged injury. Accordingly, this action may be a proper Ex Parte Young suit, by which Plaintiffs can obtai n prospective, equitable relief against the State.\\n-8-\\n\\n\\x0cThere is only a “narrow range of circumstances in which Burford can justify the dismissal of a federal action.” Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co. , 517 U.S. 706, 726 (1996). The Burford abstention doctrine provides that “[c]ourts should abstain from deciding cases presenting ‘difficult questions of state law bearing on policy problems of substantial public import whose importance transcends the result in the case th en at bar,’ or whose adjudication in a f ederal forum ‘would be disruptive of state efforts to establish a coherent policy with respe ct to a m atter o f substantia l public concern.’” First Penn-Pac. Life Ins. Co. v. Evans , 304 F.3d 345, 348 (4 th Cir. 2002) (emphasis added) (quoting New Orleans Pub. Serv., Inc. v. Council of New Orleans,491 U.S. 350, 361 (1989) (“NOPSI”)). If either one of these two groundsfor abstention is met, the Court should not exercise jurisdiction. As this Court held in its previous or der of January 29, 2014, this case does not involve difficult questions of stat e law, and therefore the f irst ground for Burford abstention is not met. ECF No. 56.\\nThe second ground for Burford abstention exists where federal jurisdiction would interrupt the State’s interest in regulatory unifor mity. See NOPSI, 491 U.S. at 362. Whether to abstain under Burford is an “equitable decision [that] balances the strong federal interest in having certain classes of cases, and certain federal rights, adjudicated in federal court, against the State’s interests in maintaining ‘uniformity in the treatment of an essentially local problem.’” Quackenbush, 517 U.S. at 728 (quoting NOPSI, 491 U.S. at 362). Burford abstention may apply where the Court determines that “the State’s interests are paramount and that a dispute would best be adjudicated in a state forum.” Id. at 728. Where, as here, the only ques tion involved is one of federal law , Burford abstention is generally inappropriate. See Martin v. Stewart, 499 F.3d 360, 368 (4th Cir. 2007) (holding that federal courts generally may not abstain from deciding purely federal issues); Harper v. Pub. Serv. Comm’n of West Virginia, 396 F.3d 348 (4th Cir. 2005) (holding that federal\\n-9-\\n\\n\\x0cjurisdiction would not disrupt state policy because case presented federal question under the Commerce Clause).\\nHere, Defendants argue that if this court awards Plaintiffs their requested relief, only the clerks of Cabell and Kanawha counties will be enjoined from refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. ECF No. 27; ECF No. 31. This, Defendants argue, would disrupt uniformity among the counties of W est Virginia. The Cour t disagrees. First, Plaintiffs request both injunctive and declaratory relief . A declaration by this c ourt tha t th e m arriage ban is unconstitutional would strike down the ban entirely, not just as applied to the def endant clerks. Even if declaratory relief cannot extend beyond the named defendants, the State has intervened in this case to defend the c onstitutionality of the marriage ban. The State has had a f ull and f air opportunity to litigate the constitutionality of the m arriage ban in this case. Accordingly, under the doctrine of res judicata, a declaratory judgment from this court would preclude the State from relitigating the issue in future proceedings. See Federated Dep’t Stores, Inc. v. Moitie, 452 U.S. 394 (1981) (“A final judgment on the merits of an action precludes the parties or their privies from relitigating issues that were or could have been raised in that action.”). In other words, the ruling would create uniform ity becau se the Stat e would be preclud ed from defending th e constitutionality of the m arriage ban in th e future.2 Second, in light of the ruling from the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Bostic v. Shaefer, 760 F.3d 352 (4th Cir. 2014), the State has discontinued its enforcem ent and defense of the m arriage ban. ECF No. 134; see also Erin Beck, W. Va. Ends Ban on Gay Marriage: Governor, A.G. Direct Their Staff to Follow\\n2 Plaintiffs also contend that any judgm ent in this case would bind all county clerks in W est Virginia because there is privity between the defendant clerks a nd the rem aining county clerks. ECF No. 61. The Court declines to reach this issue. The remaining county clerks are not parties in the p resent case. Whether they are in priv ity with the defendant clerks for purposes of preclusion is a thus not an issue properly before the Court at this time.\\n-10-\\n\\n\\x0cRuling of A ppeals Court, Charleston Gazette (WV), Oct. 10, 2014, available at Westlaw, 2014\\nWLNR 28289127. Therefore, even if this Court’s ruling only applies to the defendant clerks, it\\nwill not disrupt uniformity among the counties because the governor of West Virginia has already instructed all county clerks to issue marriage licenses to sam e-sex couples.3 See ECF No. 134;\\nBeck, W. Va. Ends Ban on Gay Marriage . Third, defendants cannot require that plaintiffs join\\nevery possible party, when the parties sued are sufficient to award the requested relief. Plaintiffs\\nproperly sued the two county clerks who refusedto issue marriage licenses under to the challenged\\nmarriage ban. ECF No. 8; see Wolf v. Walker , 9 F. Supp. 3d 889, 895 ( W.D. W is. 2014)\\n(explaining that plaintiffs prope rly sued clerks who denied th em marriage licenses and did not\\nneed to sue every county clerk in W isconsin). Finally, Plaintiffs here “have the right under 42\\nU.S.C. § 1983 to bring a lawsuit to vindicate their own constitutional rights.” See Wolf, 9 F. Supp.\\n3d at 895. The important constitutional rights at issue in this case outweigh the State’s interest in\\ndeveloping its marriage policy without scrutiny from the federal courts. See Zablocki v. Redhail,\\n434 U.S. 374, 379 n.5 ( 1978) (“[T]here is, of cour se, no doctrine requiring abstention m erely\\nbecause resolution of a federal question m ay result in th e overturning of a state policy.”). For\\nthese reasons, the Court refuses to abstain under Burford.\\nDefendant McCormick and the State also m aintain that abstention is proper pursuant to\\nBaker v. Nelson, 409 U.S. 810 (1972). ECF No. 27; ECF N o. 68. As this Court explained in a\\nprevious order, Baker is not binding on this case. ECF No. 56. Subsequent to that order, the\\n3 Defendant Cole cites the governor’s decision in support of her argument that the claims against her be dism issed as m oot. ECF No. 136. Under Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. LaidL aw Envt’l Servs., Inc. , 528 U.S. 167 (2000), the “voluntary cessa tion of a challenged practice does not deprive a federal court of its power to determine the legality of the practice.” Laidlaw, 528 U.S. at 169-70. Where, as here, a govern ment entity vol untarily ceases enforcing a specific policy b ut may legally resume its enf orcement at a late r time, the court re tains jurisdiction to rule on the constitutionality of that policy, and the issue is not m oot. See id.; see also Bell v. City of Boise , 709 F.3d 890, 900 (9th Cir. 2013).\\n-11-\\n\\n\\x0cFourth Circuit in Bostic held: “In light of the Supreme Court’s apparent abandonment of Baker and the significant doctrinal developments that occurred after the Court issued its summary dismissal in that cas e, we decline to view Baker as binding precedent.” Bostic, 760 F.3d at 375. Accordingly, Baker does not require abstention in this case. The State’s motion to dism iss and Defendants’ respective motions to dismiss are thus denied.\\nIII. Motions for Summary Judgment A. Legal Standard To obtain summary judgment, the moving party must show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). In considering a motion for summary judgment, the Court will not “weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter.” Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249 (1986). Instead, the Court will draw any permissible inference from the underlying facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587-88 (1986). Summary judgment is appropriate when the nonmoving party hasthe burden of proof on an essential elem ent of his or her case and does not m ake, after adequate tim e for discovery, a showing sufficient to es tablish that elem ent. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett , 477 U.S. 317, 322-23 (1986). The nonmoving party m ust satisfy this burden of proof by offering m ore than a m ere “scintilla of evidence” in support of his or her p osition. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252. The facts here are not in dispute. Each party has moved for summary judgment. ECF No. 40; ECF No. 62; ECF No. 66. It is thus the task of this Court toapply the law to the undisputed facts and determine which party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).\\n-12-\\n\\n\\x0cB. Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment Defendants filed a joint motion for summ ary judgment raising five arguments. ECF No. 62. First, Defendants argue that West Virginia law and the duties of their office require them to deny marriage licenses to same-sex couples. ECF No. 62. This is no defense to a constitutional challenge to that state law, which must yie ld to the supremacy of constitutional protections. As the governor of W est Virginia has now directed al l county clerks to issu e marriage licenses to same-sex couples, and Defendants have com plied with that directive, this argum ent is no longer supported. See ECF No. 134. Moreover, as discussed above, it is precisely because their actions were in compliance with the challenged m arriage ban that the county clerks are the proper defendants in this action. See id. This argument is thus without merit. Second, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have failed to join two necessary parties, the State Registrar and Secretary of State. Although Defendants phrase their arguments in terms of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19, rather than Article III, the Court’s discussion of the proper defendants in this case, outlined above in response to the State’s motion to dismiss, is equally applicable here. The State Registrar and Secretary of State need not bejoined for this Court to afford Plaintiffs their requested relief. Third, Defendants, citing United States v. Windsor , 133 S. Ct. 2675 (2013), claim that striking down West Virginia’s marriage ban would disrupt the balance between state and federal power by interfering with the State’s authority to regulate marriage under the U.S. Constitu tion. ECF No. 62. Although this Court agrees that the pow er to regulate m arriage is reserved to the states, Plaintiffs here raise a genuine issue of federal law: whet her West Virginia’s marriage ban violates the Fourteen th Amendment of the U.S. Constitu tion. As the court in Bostic explained: “Windsor does not teach us that federalism principles can justify depriving individuals of their\\n-13-\\n\\n\\x0cconstitutional rights; it reiterates Loving’s admonition that the states must exercise their authority without trampling constitu tional g uarantees. Virg inia’s federalism -based interes t in definin g marriage therefore canno t justify its encroach ment on the fundam ental right to m arry.” Bostic, 760 F.3d at 379. Bostic’s logic a pplies with equal f orce to W est Virgin ia’s m arriage ban. Principles of federalism do not outweigh this Court’s duty to ensure that West Virginia’s laws do not violate Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights.\\nFourth, Defendants claim that Baker v. Nelson controls this case and defeats Plain tiffs’ constitutional claims. As explained above, this Court and the Fourth Circuit have determined that Baker is not binding. Finally, Defendants argu e that, should this Court reach the m erits, West Virginia’s m arriage ban does not violate th e Due Proces s or E qual Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. This argument was also rais ed by the State in its motion for summary judgment and is discussed in the following section.\\nC. Plaintiffs’ Motion and the State’s Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment In the ir m otion for su mmary j udgment, Plaintiffs contend th at th at W est Virginia ’s marriage ban is unconstitutional on its face. ECF No. 41. Plaintiffs argue that the ban violates their fundam ental rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Am endment, and discriminates based on sexual orie ntation, in violation of the E qual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. ECF No. 41. The State responded and filed a cross-m otion for summ ary judgm ent, arguing that it is entitled to judgm ent as a m atter of law on three grounds. First, the State argues th at Plaintiffs’ failure to join the State Registrar an d Secretary of State precludes this Court from granting them full relief under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19. ECF No. 68. Second, the State contends that Baker v. Nelson controls this case. ECF No. 68. Third, the State m aintains that W est\\n-14-\\n\\n\\x0cVirginia’s marriage ban is constitutional. ECF No. 68. As explained in the preceding sections, the first two arguments are without merit.\\nThe State’s third argu ment, that West Vi rginia’s m arriage ban does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment, is unavailing in light of the Fourth Circuit’s decision in Bostic v. Shaefer. In Bostic, two sam e-sex couples challeng ed Virginia’s m arriage ban. Bostic, 760 F.3d at 367. Like West Virginia’s ban, Virginia law defined marriage as between one man and one woman, and refused to recognize as valid any marriage between persons of the same sex. See id. at 368. The plaintiffs in Bostic arg ued that Virginia’s m arriage ban v iolated th e Due Proces s and Equal Protection Clauses of th e Fourteenth Amendment. Id. at 369. The court be gan its analysis by determining the app licable standard of scrutiny, noting that “[u]nder both the Due P rocess and Equal Protection Clauses, interference with a fundamental right warrants the application of strict scrutiny.” Id. at 375. The court held that marriage is a funda mental right and that “the fundamental right to m arry encompasse s the right to sam e-sex m arriage.” Id. at 376. Accordingly, the court held that strict scrutiny applies whenever a law “significantly interfere[s]” with the right of sam e-sex couples to m arry. Id. at 377. Virginia’s ban on sam e-sex marriage “unquestionably” met this test, thus the court applied strict scrutiny to determine whether the ban violated the Fourteenth Amendment. Id.\\nUnder strict scrutiny, a law can survive only if it is justified by a compelling state interest and is narrowly drawn to achieve that interest. Id. (citing Carey v. Population Servs. Int’l , 431 U.S. 678, 686 (1977)). The defendants in Bostic raised five state interests that they argued could satisfy s trict scrutiny: “ (1) Virgin ia’s federali sm-based inte rest in m aintaining con trol over the definition of marriage within its borders, (2) the history and tradition of opposite-sex marriage, (3) protecting the institution of marriage, (4) encouraging responsible procreation, and (5) promoting\\n-15-\\n\\n\\x0cthe optimal childrearing environment.” Id. at 378. The Court held th at neither federalism nor Virginia’s history and tradition were com pelling state in terests suf ficient to ove rcome the fundamental right to marriage. Id. at 379-80. Furtherm ore, the Court held that Virginia’s marriage ban was not narrowly ta ilored to protect th e institu tion of m arriage, encoura ge responsible procreation, or prom ote an optim al environm ent for children. Id. at 380-84. The court thus concluded that Virginia’s laws “violate the Due Process andEqual Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the extent that they prevent same-sex couples from marrying.” Id. at 384.\\nThe holding in Bostic controls this case.4 Like Virginia’s m arriage ban, W est Virginia law defines marriage as a “union between a woman and a man” and does not recognize same-sex marriage. W. Va. Code § 48-2-104(c). Plaintiffs here raise the same constitutional challenges to West Virgin ia’s m arriage ban th at were ra ised by the p laintiffs in Bostic. ECF No. 8. Thus, following Bostic, this Court m ust apply strict scruti ny to W est Virginia ’s m arriage ban an d determine whether the ban is narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling interest. Bostic, 760 F.3d at 377.\\nWest Virgin ia asse rts two interes ts in banning sam e-sex m arriage: (1 ) an “intere st in expanding gay rights incrementally to avoid disruptive or unforeseen consequences from an abrupt change” and (2) “am eliorating a unique consequen ce of opposite-sex intercourse,” that is, the conception of children. ECF No. 68. The State also notes that the West Virginia legislature “was not motivated by a bare desire to harm homosexuals” when it enacted the m arriage ban. ECF No. 68. The State’s asserted interests fail for several reasons. 5 First, the State does not\\n4 The State concedes that Bostic “is binding precedent on the merits of this case.” ECF No. 134. 5 The Sixth Circuit in DeBoer v. Sn yder, Nos. 14-1341; 14-3057; 14-3464; 14-5291; 14-5297; 14-5818 (6th Cir. Nov. 6, 2014), reached th e opposite result. The m ajority th ere noted two\\n-16-\\n\\n\\x0ccontend that these interests were the actual motivations underlying the marriage ban. Instead, the\\nState calls them “conceivable” interests that the legislature “could re asonably have believed”\\nwould benefit the State. ECF No. 68. Unlike rational basis review, under which the courts may\\nconsider any plausible grounds for a challenged law, strict scrutiny limits the Court’s analysis to\\nthe State’s actual purpose for enacting the challenged law. See Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U.S. 899, 908\\nn. 4 (1996) (“[A] racial classification cannot w ithstand strict scrutiny based upon speculation\\nabout what ‘m ay have motivated ’ the legis lature. To be a com pelling interest, th e State m ust\\nshow that the alleged objective w as the legis lature’s ‘actual purpose’ for the discrim inatory\\nclassification.” (quoting Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, 730, n. 16 (1982)));\\nF.C.C. v. Beach Commc’ns, Inc., 508 U.S. 307 (1993) (explaining that under rational basis review,\\na statute stands “if there is any reaso nably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational\\nbasis” for th e law). The State has not cited any legislative hist ory or other evidence indicating\\nthat the “conceivable” interests it proffers actually motivated the legislature to enact the marriage\\nban. The State does contend that the ban was not motivated by animus, but that alone does not\\ndemonstrate that the State has a compelling interest in banning same-sex marriage.\\nrationales in support of the m arriage bans. DeBoer v. Snyder, Nos. 14-1341; 14-3057; 14-3464; 14-5291; 14-5297; 14-5818, at 21. First, the court found the m arriage bans in Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, and T ennessee to be rooted in the S tates’ interest in regulating procreation by providing incentives for parents to remain together. Id. But the opinion then conceded that this view of m arriage can no longer be sustained, that m arriage now serves “another value—to solemnize relationships characterized by love, affection, and commitment.” Id. at 20. Denying marital status and its benefits to a couple that cannot procreate does nothing to further the original interest of regulating procrea tion and irrationally excludes the couple from the latter purpose of marriage. Second, the majority in DeBoer implores opponents of the marriage bans to proceed slowly, through the legislative process, and justifies the bans by asserting the States’ right to take a “wait and see” approach. Id. at 21. This approach, however, fails to recognize the role of courts in the democratic process. It is the duty of the judiciary to exam ine government action through the lens of the Constitution’s protection of individual freedom. Courts cannot avoid or deny this duty just b ecause it arises du ring the con tentious public debate that often acco mpanies the evolution of policy m aking throughout the states . Judges may not simultaneously find a right violated yet defer to an uncertain future remedy voluntarily undertaken by the violators.\\n-17-\\n\\n\\x0cEven if the asserted interests do represent th e actual objectives that the State sought to achieve by enacting the m arriage ban, these interests cannot survive strict scrutiny. The State’s first interest is avoiding an “abrupt” change to state policy. This interest is not compelling under Bostic. In Bostic, the court held that “[p]reserving the historical and traditional status quo” is not a com pelling state in terest. Bostic, 760 F.3d at 380. Furtherm ore, the court explained that legalizing same-sex marriage will not destabilize the institution of marriage. Id. at 381.\\nTo the extent that W est Vi rginia’s interest goes beyond preserving tradition and the institution of marriage, it is still not compelling. The State’s laws directly violate the due process and equal protection rights of same-sex couples. The fact that overturning these laws may cause an “abrupt” change does not m ean that th e laws must not be overturned. Watershed decisions under the equal protection and due process clauses have often brought sudden change. In Loving v. Virgin ia, 388 U.S. 1 (1967), for exam ple, the Su preme Court struck down Virginia’s anti-miscegenation statute. Loving, 388 U.S. at 12. At the time, sixteen other states had similar laws, and penalties for m iscegenation had been “co mmon in Virginia since the colonial period.” Id. at 6. The Court’s decision had the potential to abruptly change the regulation of m arriage in Virginia and fifteen other states. See id. at 12. Nevertheless, the C ourt invalidated the law, concluding that it could not sta nd because “restricting th e freedom to m arry sole ly b ecause of racial classifications vio lates the central m eaning of the Equa l Protection Clause” and because “[t]he freedom to marry has long been recognized as one of the vitalpersonal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.” Id. Likewise, restricting the freedom to marry based on sexual orientation violates the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses. Bostic, 760 F.3d at 384. That change may come to West Virginia more immediately than the legislature had hoped is not a compelling reason to allow an unconstitutional ban to stand. Moreover, as explained above,\\n-18-\\n\\n\\x0cWest Virginia has already implemented changes to its policy on same-sex marriage and has begun to issue m arriage licenses to sam e-sex couples. ECF No. 134. It is theref ore unlikely that this Court’s decision will cause an abru pt change to current state policy. The State’s first asserted interest thus cannot survive strict scrutiny.\\nThe State’s second proffered interest is in “ameliorating” the issues that arise “[w]hen opposite-sex couples conceive an u nplanned child and then shirk re sponsibility.” ECF No. 68. The State argues that opposite-sex and same-sex couples are not similarly situated with respect to marriage because “[o]nly one group can have unplanned pregnancies. ” ECF No. 68. That characteristic, the State concludes, “is a conceivable explanation for the Legislature’s decision to create only for that group an in centive under the law to stay toge ther.” ECF No. 68. Although the State may have a com pelling interest in prom oting oppos ite-sex m arriage an d preven ting parents from abandoning their responsibilities, the marriage ban is not narrowly tailored to achieve this goal. I n Bostic, the defendants asserted a sim ilar inte rest, arguing that Virginia sought to provide stability to oppos ite-sex relationships because they ca n result in unplanned pregnancies. See Bostic, 760 F.3d at 381. The Fourth Circuit held that if this was the marriage ban’s purpose, the law was “woefully underinclusive,” pointing out that “[s]a me-sex couples are not the only category of couples who cannot reproduce accidentally.” Id. The court continued: “Because same-sex couples and infertile opposite-sex couple s are sim ilarly situated, the Equal Protection Clause counsels against treati ng these groups differently.” Id. Moreover, the Court explained that “[p]rohibiting same-sex c ouples from marrying . . . does not serve Virginia’s goal of preventing out-of-wedlock births.” Id. at 382. West Virginia’s ba n is equally underinclusive, making no distinction between opp osite-sex couples who can conc eive children and those who cannot. See W. Va. Code §§ 48-2-104(a) & (c), 48-2-401. Furtherm ore, prohibiting sam e-sex\\n-19-\\n\\n\\x0cmarriage does not, in any m anner, prevent oppos ite-sex couples from having unwanted children and then abandoning their responsibilities with respect to those children. See Bostic, 760 F.3d at 382. The ban is thus not narrowly drawn to achie ve the State’s asserted interest. As W est Virginia’s marriage ban is no t narrowly tailored to a chieve a com pelling state interest, it canno t survive strict scrutiny.\\nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment is GRANTED and the State’s cross-motion for summary judgment and Defendant’s joint motion for summary judgment are DENIED. The Court grants the Plaintiffs’ request ed relief and hereby declares that W est Virginia Code § 48-2-104(a) & (c) and West Virginia Code § 48-2-401 are unconstitutional in so far as they prohibit sam e-sex m arriage. More over, the Court enjoins Defendant Clerks from enforcing West Virginia Code § 48-2-104(a) & (c) and West Vi rginia Code § 48-2-401 to the extent that these statu tes have be en decla red unconstitu tional. Fin ally, th e Court enjo ins Defendant Clerks from refusing to accept application s and issue m arriage licenses to sam e-sex couples on the same terms as opposite-sex couples under West Virginia Code § 48-2-104(a) & (c) and West Virginia Code § 48-2-401.\\nIV. Motion to Continue Stay and Calendar Oral Argument and Cross-Motion to Lift Stay and Enter Judgment\\nThe State previously filed a motion requesting that the Court continue its stay on the merits until after the U.S. Court of Appeals forthe Fourth Circuit issued its mandate in Bostic and that the Court schedule oral argum ent on the threshold i ssues in this case. ECF No. 126. Plaintiff’s responded to the State’s motion with a cross-motion to lift the stay and enter judgment. ECF No. 127. This Court sua sponte continued the stay on the m erits pending the Suprem e Court’s decision on the Pe tition f or a W rit of Certio rari in Bostic. ECF No. 130. Accordingly, the State’s motion to continue the stay, and Plaintiffs’ cross-motion to lift the stay and enter judgment,\\n-20-\\n\\n\\x0care DENIED AS MOOT . Furtherm ore, the Court finds that oral argum ent on the threshold issues in this case is not necessary and would not aid the Courtin rendering its opinion. Thus, the motion to calendar oral argument is DENIED.\\nV. Motion and Amended Motion to Lift Stay and Enter Judgment Following the Suprem e Court’s decision to deny the Petitio n for a W rit of Certiorari in Bostic, Plaintiffs moved this court to lift the stay and enter judgment. The Court previously lifted the stay (ECF No. 133) and now enters judgment in this case in favor of Plaintiffs. Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ motion is GRANTED.\\nConclusion For the reasons state above, Plaintif f’s Motion for Summ ary Judgment (ECF No. 40) is GRANTED. Defendant Vera J. McCorm ick’s Moti on to Dism iss (ECF No. 26), Defendant Karen S. Cole’s Motio n to Dism iss (ECF No. 31), Defendants’ Joint Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 62), the State of West Virginia’s Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 66), and the State of W est Virginia’s Motion to Dism iss (ECF No. 85) are DENIED. The State of W est Virgin ia’s Motion to Continue Me rits Stay and to Cale ndar Oral Argum ent on Threshold Issues (ECF No. 126) is DENIED in part and DENIED AS MOOT in part . Plaintiff’s Cross-Motion to Lift Stay and Enter Judgment (ECF No. 127) is DENIED AS MOOT. Plaintiff’s Motion and Amended Motion to Lift Stay and Enter Judgment (ECF No. 131, ECF No. 132) are GRANTED.

McCormick to dismiss the complaint (ECF No. 26), a motion by Defendant Karen S. Cole to dismiss the complaint (ECF No. 31), and a motion by Intervenor Defendant the State of West Virginia to dismiss the complaint (ECF No. 34). Also pending are a motion by Defendant McCormick and Defendant Cole (collectively “Defendant Clerks”) to strike Plaintiffs’ notice of supplemental authority (ECF No. 45) and a motion by Intervenor Defendant the State of West Virginia to amend the deadline to respond to Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 53).\\n\\n\\x0cFor the reasons stated below, the motion to strike (ECF No. 45) is GRANTED in part; the Court will consider the two exhibits attached to Plaintiffs’ notice of supplemental authority but will not consider legal argument presented in the memorandum accompanying those exhibits. The Court DENIES in part Defendant Clerks’ motions to dismiss (ECF Nos. 26, 31) and RESERVES ruling as to abstention arising from the issue of whether the existing Defendants are sufficient to bind state authorities and all county clerks, should a ruling on the merits be made in favor of Plaintiffs. The Court DIRECTS Plaintiffs, by February 12, 2014, to either 1) seek joinder of whatever additional parties they deem necessary to create greater certainty as to the effect of a ruling in this case, or 2) file a responsive pleading explaining why the existing Defendants in this lawsuit are sufficient to bind state authorities and all county clerks should a ruling on the merits be made in favor of Plaintiffs and why joinder of additional parties is not necessary. Defendants may file a response within seven days of Plaintiffs taking either action, and Plaintiffs may file a reply within three days of any response from Defendants.\\nThe Court GRANTS the State’s motion to dismiss (ECF No. 34) and accordingly DISMISSES Plaintiffs’ claims pertaining to West Virginia Code Section 48-2-603 (the nonrecognition provision); Plaintiffs’ claims as to the other portions of the marriage ban may proceed. However, the Court ORDERS that Plaintiffs may amend their Complaint by February 12, 2014. Lastly, the Court ORDERS that Defendants shall have 14 days from entry of this Memorandum Opinion and Order to file any responses to Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment. The Court accordingly DENIES as moot the State’s motion to amend the deadline (ECF No. 53).\\nI. Statement of Facts\\n2\\n\\n\\x0cPlaintiffs in this case seek to overturn West Virginia Code Sections 48-2-104, 48-2-401, and 48-2-603, as well as “any other sources of West Virginia law that exclude same-sex couples from marriage or from recognition of marriages entered into in another jurisdiction” (collectively called the “marriage ban”). Compl. 28, ECF No. 8.\\nWest Virginia Code Section 48-2-104 specifies the required contents for marriage license applications. Among other requirements, “[t]he application for a marriage license must contain a statement of the full names of both the female and the male parties” and “must contain the following statement: ‘Marriage is designed to be a loving and lifelong union between a woman and a man.’” W. Va. Code § 48-2-104(a) & (c). Section 48-2-401 governs persons authorized to perform marriages and states in part, “Celebration or solemnization of a marriage means the performance of the formal act or ceremony by which a man and woman contract marriage and assume the status of husband and wife.” Lastly, Section 48-2-603 prohibits a same-sex marriage performed outside of West Virginia from being recognized as a valid marriage within West Virginia: “A public act, record or judicial proceeding of any other state, territory, possession or tribe respecting a relationship between persons of the same sex that is treated as a marriage under the laws of the other state, territory, possession, or tribe, or a right or claim arising from such relationship, shall not be given effect by this state.”\\nSix of the plaintiffs are gay and lesbian West Virginians, comprising three same-sex adult couples: Casie Jo McGee and Sarah Elizabeth Adkins; Justin Murdock and William Glavaris; and Nancy Elizabeth Michael and Jane Louise Fenton. The seventh plaintiff, A.S.M., is the minor child of Ms. Michael and Ms. Fenton. Plaintiffs bring this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against Karen S. Cole, in her official capacity as Cabell County Clerk, and against Vera J. McCormick, in her official capacity as Kanawha County Clerk. Defendant Clerks are responsible\\n3\\n\\n\\x0cfor issuing marriage licenses and recording marriages that take place in jurisdictions outside of\\nWest Virginia. Their responsibilities include ensuring that marriage licenses and records of out-\\nof-state marriages conform with West Virginia law, including the West Virginia marriage ban.\\nPlaintiffs argue that Defendant Clerks are violating Plaintiffs’ due process rights and equal\\nprotection rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\\nPlaintiffs accordingly request that this Court declare the marriage ban to be unconstitutional and\\nenjoin enforcement of the marriage ban.\\nThe State of West Virginia filed a motion to intervene as a defendant, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2403(b)1 and Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 5.1(c) and 24(a), to defend the\\nconstitutionality of the marriage ban. ECF No. 25. The Court granted this motion, allowing the\\nState to proceed as an Intervenor Defendant. ECF No. 28.\\nDefendant Clerks and the State have each filed a separate motion to dismiss. ECF Nos.\\n26, 31, 34. Plaintiffs have filed a notice of supplemental authority in opposition to Defendant\\nClerks’ motions to dismiss. ECF No. 44. Defendant Clerks jointly move for the Court to strike\\nthe notice of supplemental authority. ECF No. 45. All of these motions are now ripe for\\nresolution and will be addressed in this Memorandum Opinion and Order.\\nPlaintiffs have also filed a motion for summary judgment. ECF No. 40. Defendant Clerks\\nand the State jointly moved to stay briefing on Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment until\\n1 This section provides: “In any action, suit, or proceeding in a court of the United States to which a State or any agency, officer, or employee thereof is not a party, wherein the constitutionality of any statute of that State affecting the public interest is drawn in question, the court shall certify such fact to the attorney general of the State, and shall permit the State to intervene for presentation of evidence, if evidence is otherwise admissible in the case, and for argument on the question of constitutionality.”\\n28 U.S.C. § 2403(b). 4\\n\\n\\x0cresolution of the motions to dismiss. ECF No. 43. In an Order dated January 17, 2014, the Court directed that Defendants’ responses to Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment would be due seven days after the entry of a Memorandum Opinion and Order resolving the motions to dismiss. ECF No. 52. The State has filed a motion to amend that deadline. ECF No. 53.\\nIn Section II, the Court discusses the motion to strike. Section III examines whether the Court should abstain from exercising jurisdiction over this matter. Section IV discusses whether Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim for relief. Section V analyzes whether Plaintiffs have standing to challenge West Virginia Code Section 48-2-603, the non-recognition statute. Section VI discusses the State’s motion to extend the deadline to respond to Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment.\\nII. Motion to Strike On January 3, 2014, Plaintiffs filed a notice of supplemental authority in opposition to the motions to dismiss filed by Defendant Clerks. ECF No. 44. Plaintiffs attached two recent decisions to this notice that they believe should be considered by the Court in ruling on the motions to dismiss. The first is a decision by the District Court for the District of Utah in Kitchen v. Herbert, holding that Utah’s prohibition on same-sex marriage is unconstitutional. No. 2:13CV-217, 2013 WL 6697874 (D. Utah Dec. 20, 2013). The second is a decision by the District Court for the Southern District of Ohio in Obergefell v. Wymyslo, holding that Ohio must recognize valid same-sex marriages from other states on Ohio death certificates. No. 1:13-CV501, 2013 WL 6726688 (S.D. Ohio Dec. 23, 2013).\\n5\\n\\n\\x0cDefendant Clerks filed a joint motion to strike this notice of supplemental authority. ECF No. 45. They argue that pursuant to Local Rule of Civil Procedure 7.1(a)(7),2 Plaintiffs were required to seek leave of the Court before filing this supplemental memorandum, which Plaintiffs did not do. Defendant Clerks argue that, in essence, this filing is an impermissible surreply and that, even had leave to file a surreply been requested, there would be no basis to grant that leave. Defendant Clerks point out that the two cases are outside the Fourth Circuit and rely upon case law that may conflict with Fourth Circuit precedent, making the decisions of limited value here. Furthermore, Defendant Clerks suggest that Plaintiffs did not timely bring these decisions to the Court’s attention. Kitchen v. Herbert was issued three days before Plaintiffs filed a response to Defendant Cole’s motion to dismiss, and Obergefell v. Wymyslo—issued the same day that Plaintiffs filed their response to Defendant Cole’s motion to dismiss—was available for seven days before Defendant Cole filed her reply. Plaintiffs respond that their filing is not a surreply and instead should be treated as a notice of supplemental authority, although the federal rules and local rules do not explicitly allow such a filing.\\nThe Court notes that Plaintiffs filed this notice of supplemental authority 11 and 14 days after the respective decisions were issued, shortly after the Court resumed normal operations following winter holidays. Although Plaintiffs should have sought leave before making this filing, as a practical matter the Court would have read these two cases regardless. For these reasons, the Court allows the exhibits but strikes any legal argument presented in the memorandum accompanying the exhibits. Therefore, the motion to strike is granted in part.\\nIII. Abstention\\n2 That Rule states in part: “Surreply memoranda shall not be filed except by leave of court. These times for serving memoranda may be modified by the judicial officer to whom the motion is addressed.” L. R. Civ. P. 7.1(a)(7).\\n6\\n\\n\\x0cDefendant Clerks have filed separate motions to dismiss, each arguing that the Court should abstain from exercising jurisdiction in this case. As these arguments substantially overlap, the Court will discuss the arguments from both Clerks concerning abstention in this Section.\\nAbstention can take many forms, including the “Burford abstention doctrine,” which is based on the Supreme Court’s decision in Burford v. Sun Oil Company, 319 U.S. 315 (1943). As explained by the Fourth Circuit, the Burford abstention doctrine provides that “[c]ourts should abstain from deciding cases presenting ‘difficult questions of state law bearing on policy problems of substantial public import whose importance transcends the result in the case then at bar,’ or whose adjudication in a federal forum ‘would be disruptive of state efforts to establish a coherent policy with respect to a matter of substantial public concern.’” First Penn-Pac. Life Ins. Co. v. Evans, 304 F.3d 345, 348 (4th Cir. 2002) (emphasis added) (quoting New Orleans Pub. Serv., Inc. v. Council of New Orleans, 491 U.S. 350, 361 (1989) (“NOPSI”)). If either one of these two prongs is met, the Court should abstain from exercising jurisdiction in this case. Notably, “abstention is . . . ‘the exception, not the rule.’” Id. (quoting Colo. River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, 424 U.S. 800, 813 (1976)). Many considerations factor into determining whether Burford abstention is appropriate in a given case:\\n[W]hether the constitutional challenge is of minimal federal importance, involving only whether a state commission had properly applied the state’s own regulations; the “intricacy” and importance of the state’s regulatory scheme; whether the state had created a centralized system of judicial review, which permitted state courts to develop expertise in interpreting the scheme and the industry; the speed and adequacy of state court review; and the likelihood of “[d]elay, misunderstanding of local law, and needless federal conflict with the state policy.” Goodhart v. Bd. of Visitors of Univ. of Va., 451 F. Supp. 2d 804, 807-08 (W.D. Va. 2006) (footnote omitted) (quoting NOPSI, 491 U.S. at 360).\\n7\\n\\n\\x0cIn this Section, the Court will first discuss whether this case presents “difficult questions\\nof state law.” Then the Court will turn to whether adjudication here “would be disruptive of state\\nefforts to establish a coherent policy.” Lastly, the Court will analyze the effect that Baker v.\\nNelson, 409 U.S. 810 (1972), has on the issue of abstention, if any effect at all.\\nA. Whether the case involves “difficult questions of state law bearing on policy problems of substantial public import whose importance transcends the result in the case then at bar”\\nThe Supreme Court discussed Burford abstention at length in Ankenbrandt v. Richards,\\n504 U.S. 689 (1992). In that case, a mother acting on behalf of her daughters brought a tort\\naction against the father of her children and the father’s girlfriend for child abuse. The Supreme\\nCourt examined whether the federal court should abstain from exercising jurisdiction over the\\ncase, which was in federal court solely based on diversity jurisdiction. In examining this issue,\\nthe Court found that there was a “domestic relations exception” to federal jurisdiction but\\nconstrued this exception very narrowly. The Court held that “the domestic relations exception\\n. . . divests the federal courts of power to issue divorce, alimony, and child custody decrees.” Id.\\nat 703. However, cases seeking issuance of a decree were distinguished from cases seeking\\nenforcement of a decree. See id. at 693-94. The Court explained the rationale behind the\\nexception:\\nIssuance of decrees of this type not infrequently involves retention of jurisdiction by the court and deployment of social workers to monitor compliance. As a matter of judicial economy, state courts are more eminently suited to work of this type than are federal courts, which lack the close association with state and local government organizations dedicated to handling issues that arise out of conflicts over divorce, alimony, and child custody decrees. Moreover, as a matter of judicial expertise, it makes far more sense to retain the rule that federal courts lack power to issue these types of decrees because of the special proficiency developed by state tribunals over the past century and a half in handling issues that arise in the granting of such decrees.\\nId. at 703-04.\\n8\\n\\n\\x0cThe Court also acknowledged that Burford abstention “might be relevant in a case involving elements of the domestic relationship even when the parties do not seek divorce, alimony, or child custody.” Id. at 705. The Court explained:\\nThis would be so when a case presents difficult questions of state law bearing on policy problems of substantial public import whose importance transcends the result in the case then at bar. Such might well be the case if a federal suit were filed prior to effectuation of a divorce, alimony, or child custody decree, and the suit depended on a determination of the status of the parties. Id. at 705-06 (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted). Applying that logic to the case before it, the Court declined to abstain because “the status of the domestic relationship has been determined as a matter of state law, and in any event has no bearing on the underlying torts alleged.” Id. at 706 (footnote omitted). Defendant Clerks point to Ankenbrandt to support their argument that the case presents “difficult questions of state law bearing on policy problems of substantial public import whose importance transcends the result in the case then at bar,” First Penn-Pac., 304 F.3d at 348, thus making abstention appropriate. They argue that the Supreme Court’s statement that Burford abstention “might be relevant in a case involving elements of the domestic relationship even when the parties do not seek divorce, alimony, or child custody,” Ankenbrandt, 504 U.S. at 705, supports abstention in the instant case. The Court believes that this reading of the domestic relations exception is too expansive. The example given in Ankenbrandt of a case involving “difficult questions of state law” is a “suit depend[ing] on a determination of the status of the parties.” Id. at 706. This indicates that abstention would be appropriate when disposition of the federal case depends on a state court’s decision about how state domestic relations law should be interpreted and applied. The instant case, however, does not present such a situation. Like in Ankenbrandt, here “the status of the domestic relationship has [already] been determined as a\\n9\\n\\n\\x0cmatter of state law,” id.,—namely, state law has made it clear that same-sex marriages cannot be entered into or recorded in West Virginia.\\nThis conclusion is also supported by Zablocki v. Redhail, 434 U.S. 374 (1978), where the plaintiffs challenged a Wisconsin statute prohibiting residents with child support obligations from marrying without first obtaining a court order granting permission to marry. In finding abstention inappropriate, the Supreme Court noted that there were “no ambiguities in the statute for the state courts to resolve.” Id. at 379 n.5.3 Like the statute in Zablocki, West Virginia’s marriage ban is not ambiguous as to its prohibition of same-sex marriages. This case accordingly does not present “difficult questions of state law.” Defendant Cole argues that the case at hand presents more complex issues than Zablocki, in part because Plaintiffs are attempting to redefine marriage. This argument misses the point, however, that the marriage ban is unambiguous and clear as to its impact on couples; that lack of ambiguity—and not the complexity of the case overall—is the relevant inquiry for determining whether the case presents a difficult question of state law. See also Colo. River, 424 U.S. at 815 (finding abstention inappropriate because “[w]hile state claims are involved in the case, the state law to be applied appears to be settled. No questions bearing on state policy are presented for decision.”).\\nFourth Circuit precedent further supports the finding that this case does not involve difficult questions of state law. In Johnson v. Collins Entertainment Company, 199 F.3d 710 (4th Cir. 1999), the Fourth Circuit found that the district court below should have abstained pursuant to Burford from exercising jurisdiction over a case alleging violations of South Carolina law and of the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations (“RICO”) Act. In so finding, the Fourth Circuit noted that the parties contested the meaning of state gambling law and that the district\\n3 The fact that the Court was not specifically discussing Burford abstention does not change the relevance of this point.\\n10\\n\\n\\x0ccourt “was necessarily trying to predict how the South Carolina Supreme Court would decide” that meaning. Id. at 720. Even though the plaintiffs also claimed RICO violations, the “[p]laintiffs’ claims depend[ed] ultimately on alleged violations of state law for their predicate acts.” Id. at 722. The Fourth Circuit came to the opposite conclusion in Martin v. Stewart, 499 F.3d 360 (4th Cir. 2007), finding that abstention was not appropriate in a case challenging South Carolina gambling law based on the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses. The Fourth Circuit found that interpretation of the statutes at that time did not present difficult questions of state law. For example, in regards to the claim that a certain statute was unconstitutionally vague, the Fourth Circuit noted:\\n[T]he state law component of a vagueness challenge—whether limiting constructions apply to the language—is settled: the State’s highest court has expressly held that the statutory text is to be given its ordinary meaning. The remaining question—whether the statute’s ordinary meaning is unconstitutionally vague—is a matter of federal law. Thus, because state law is now “clear and certain,” Burford abstention is inappropriate. Id. at 366 (citation omitted). The Court finds that the instant case is more analogous to Martin than Johnson. Here, the interpretation of the West Virginia marriage ban is clear as an issue of state law; the only remaining issue is whether the ban violates federal law. In summary, this case does not present difficult questions of state law, and therefore fails to satisfy the first possible ground for Burford abstention. Next, the Court turns to whether this case instead satisfies the second possible ground for abstention under Burford.\\nB. Whether “adjudication in a federal forum would be disruptive of state efforts to establish a coherent policy with respect to a matter of substantial public concern” Under the second ground for abstention in Burford, this Court should abstain from\\nexercising jurisdiction in this case if the case’s “adjudication in a federal forum ‘would be disruptive of state efforts to establish a coherent policy with respect to a matter of substantial public concern.’” First Penn-Pac., 304 F.3d at 348. Although common sense indicates that\\n11\\n\\n\\x0cdefining marriage is a matter of substantial public concern, it is a closer question whether this Court’s adjudication of the case would be disruptive of state efforts to establish a coherent policy. In Zablocki, the Supreme Court found that the Minnesota statute—unambiguous on its face as to who had to obtain a court order before marrying—“does not involve complex issues of state law, resolution of which would be ‘disruptive of state efforts to establish a coherent policy with respect to a matter of substantial public concern.’” Zablocki, 434 U.S. at 379 n.5 (quoting Colo. River, 424 U.S. at 814-15). Furthermore, the Supreme Court noted that “there is, of course, no doctrine requiring abstention merely because resolution of a federal question may result in the overturning of a state policy.” Id.; see also Martin, 499 F.3d at 367 (citing Zablocki and other cases for this proposition).\\nDefendant Clerks point to state legislative efforts over the past decade or so concerning same-sex marriage as evidence of “state efforts to establish a coherent policy,” including a House of Delegates bill allowing civil unions between same-sex couples and a Senate joint resolution proposing a state constitutional amendment that would prohibit same-sex marriage. They argue that the state legislature—as the elected representatives of the citizens of West Virginia—should be given the opportunity to continue these efforts in the next legislative session. Defendants point to no cases, however, suggesting that legislative efforts to define domestic relations justify federal court abstention, and the Court has not found any. Additionally—although this point is more relevant for Younger abstention rather than Burford abstention—, there are no pending state court cases in West Virginia on the issue of same-sex marriage.\\nDefendant McCormick points out that if the marriage ban is struck down, only clerks in Kanawka and Cabell Counties will be impacted, resulting in confusion and the lack of a uniform\\n12\\n\\n\\x0cpolicy regarding same-sex marriages across West Virginia. Although it may be true that a state court trial-level case striking down the marriage ban would result in no less confusion and lack of uniformity, the Court is nonetheless troubled with how resolution of this case could create disjointed policy across West Virginia. Review of other cases has illustrated this concern. In Zablocki, for example, the plaintiffs brought suit against the County Clerk of Milwaukee County, individually and as representative of a class consisting of all county clerks in Wisconsin. Also, in Martin v. Stewart—challenging South Carolina gambling law—suit was brought against the Chief of the State Law Enforcement Division, the Attorney General, and the Solicitor of the Ninth Judicial Circuit. The Fourth Circuit noted that the claims did not “threaten a state interest in uniform regulation” because the plaintiff “launche[d] a facial attack on the state statutes as a whole—precisely the sort of case federal courts often and expertly entertain.” 499 F.3d at 367 (emphasis in original). In Martin, there was certainty as to the result if the statutes at issue were ruled unconstitutional because the defendants collectively were deemed to represent the entire authority of the State of South Carolina. In Kitchen v. Herbert—striking down the prohibition of same-sex marriage found in Utah’s Constitution—, the plaintiffs filed suit against the Governor of Utah, the Attorney General, and the Salt Lake County Clerk.\\nIn contrast, however, the Court is not certain that the parties before it in the instant case are sufficient to bind all clerks and state officials in West Virginia should the marriage ban be struck down. Specifically, while it is generally true that “the intervenor is treated as if the intervenor were an original party and has equal standing with the original parties,” 7C Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1920 (3d ed.) (footnote omitted), the Court is concerned as to whether the State’s inclusion as an Intervenor Defendant— represented by the Attorney General—is sufficient to support jurisdiction and create certainty as\\n13\\n\\n\\x0cto this case’s effect on all clerks across West Virginia’s two federal districts. The Court notes that the parties presented relatively little argument on this point. While this concern in creating a coherent policy is sufficient ground for abstention, the Court declines to so rule at this time. Instead, the Court reserves its determination of this factor in the abstention analysis. The Court directs Plaintiffs, by February 12, 2014, to either 1) seek joinder of whatever additional parties they deem necessary to create greater certainty as to the effect of a ruling in this case, or 2) file a responsive pleading explaining why the existing Defendants in this lawsuit are sufficient to bind state authorities and all county clerks should a ruling on the merits be made in favor of Plaintiffs and why joinder of additional parties is not necessary. Defendants may file a response within seven days of Plaintiffs taking either action, and Plaintiffs may file a reply within three days of any response from Defendants.\\nC. Effect of Baker v. Nelson Defendant McCormick also argues that abstention is proper pursuant to Baker v. Nelson,\\n409 U.S. 810 (1972). That case was an appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Minnesota, which held below that 1) although a Minnesota statute defining marriage did not expressly prohibit same-sex marriage, neither did that statute authorize same-sex marriage, and 2) the statute did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Baker v. Nelson, 191 N.W.2d 185 (Minn. 1971). On appeal, the Supreme Court of the United States simply stated, “The appeal is dismissed for want of a substantial federal question.” 409 U.S. at 810. Defendant McCormick argues that, because the U.S. Supreme Court found a substantial federal question lacking in Baker, this Court should likewise decline to exercise jurisdiction.\\nThis Court must determine to what degree it is bound by the Baker decision. As explained by the Supreme Court in a subsequent case:\\n14\\n\\n\\x0cBecause a summary affirmance is an affirmance of the judgment only, the rationale of the affirmance may not be gleaned solely from the opinion below.\\n“When we summarily affirm, without opinion, . . . we affirm the judgment but not necessarily the reasoning by which it was reached. . . .” (Footnote omitted.) Fusari v. Steinberg, 419 U.S. 379, 391-392, 95 S.Ct. 533, 541, 42 L.Ed.2d 521 (1975) (Burger, C. J., concurring).\\nSummary affirmances and dismissals for want of a substantial federal question without doubt reject the specific challenges presented in the statement of jurisdiction and do leave undisturbed the judgment appealed from. They do prevent lower courts from coming to opposite conclusions on the precise issues presented and necessarily decided by those actions.\\nMandel v. Bradley, 432 U.S. 173, 176 (1977). Although summary affirmance of a specific\\nquestion is binding on lower courts as a general rule, there are circumstances where that\\nsummary affirmance is no longer binding. For example, “[t]he precedential significance of the\\nsummary action . . . is to be assessed in the light of all of the facts in that case,” with special\\nattention paid to whether “those facts are very different from the facts of [the pending] case.” Id.\\nat 177.\\nIn Hicks v. Miranda, 422 U.S. 332 (1975), the Supreme Court discussed other\\ncircumstances where a summary decision is no longer binding. The Supreme Court in Hicks\\nfound that the district court below erroneously disregarded the Supreme Court’s summary\\ndecision from another case. In so finding, the Supreme Court noted:\\nThe District Court should have followed the Second Circuit’s advice, first, in Port Authority Bondholders Protective Committee v. Port of New York Authority, 387 F.2d 259, 263 n. 3 (1967), that [“]unless and until the Supreme Court should instruct otherwise, inferior federal courts had best adhere to the view that if the Court has branded a question as unsubstantial, it remains so except when doctrinal developments indicate otherwise[”] and, later, in Doe v. Hodgson, 478 F.2d 537, 539, cert. denied, sub nom. Doe v. Brennan, 414 U.S. 1096, 94 S. Ct. 732, 38 L.Ed.2d 555 (1973), that the lower courts are bound by summary decisions by this Court “until such time as the Court informs (them) that (they) are not.”\\n15\\n\\n\\x0cHicks, 422 U.S. at 344-45.4 The Court acknowledges that the questions presented by Baker and the instant case are\\nsimilar in some regards. Both are challenging the constitutionality of a state statute which prohibits same-sex marriage. Both challenge the state statutes on the grounds of due process and equal protection. And the decision of the Supreme Court of Minnesota indeed appears to rest on a finding that the statute presents neither a due process violation nor an equal protection violation. See Baker, 191 N.W.2d at 187 (“The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, like the due process clause, is not offended by the state’s classification of persons authorized to marry.”). Plaintiffs argue, however, that vital differences between the cases mean that Baker is not binding precedent. For example, the instant case includes claims on behalf of a minor child of the one of the couples. The instant case alleges discrimination based on sexual orientation, sex, and parental status. Baker, however, appeared to rest solely on analysis of discrimination based on sex. Id. (“[I]n commonsense and in a constitutional sense, there is a clear distinction between a marital restriction based merely upon race and one based upon the fundamental difference in sex.”). However, as explained by the Second Circuit, the precise issue presented and decided in Baker was “whether same-sex marriage may be constitutionally restricted by the states.” Windsor v. United States, 699 F.3d 169, 178 (2d Cir. 2012), aff’d, 133 S. Ct. 2675 (U.S. 2013). That is the same issue presented here. Therefore, at this time, the Court declines to find that differences in the facts of each case or the issues presented warrant nonapplication of Baker to this case.\\n4 The fact that this doctrinal developments exception comes from the Second Circuit does not suggest that it is limited to cases involving application of Second Circuit law. After all, the Supreme Court applied that exception in Hicks, which was an appeal from a district court within the Ninth Circuit.\\n16\\n\\n\\x0cDoctrinal developments since Baker, however, do justify a finding that Baker is nonbinding. As noted by the Second Circuit in Windsor v. United States, “[e]ven if Baker might have had resonance . . . in 1971, it does not today.” 699 F.3d at 178. In Windsor, the Second Circuit found that Baker did not foreclose jurisdiction over review of the federal Defense of Marriage Act (“DOMA”). Citing Hicks’s discussion of doctrinal developments, the Second Circuit found that doctrinal developments in the Supreme Court’s equal protection jurisprudence foreclosed the application of Baker. Those developments included: the creation of the term “intermediate scrutiny” in Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 218 (1976) (Rhenquist, J., dissenting); the treatment of classifications based on sex and illegitimacy as quasi-suspect, as seen in Lalli v. Lalli, 439 U.S. 259, 264-65 (1978); and the Supreme Court ruling there was no rational basis for “a classification of [homosexuals] undertaken for its own sake,” as explained in Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 635 (1996). Windsor, 699 F.3d at 178-79.5\\nIn Kitchen v. Herbert, the District Court for the District of Utah likewise found that “the [Supreme] Court’s summary dismissal in Baker has little if any precedential effect today” in light of doctrinal developments in equal protection and due process jurisprudence. 2013 WL 6697874, at *8. Furthermore, the district court found that the Supreme Court’s decision in Windsor represented yet another “significant doctrinal development,” as “the Windsor Court foresaw that its ruling would precede a number of lawsuits in state and lower federal courts raising the question of a state’s ability to prohibit same-sex marriage, a fact that was noted by two dissenting justices”—Justices Roberts and Scalia. Id. In Bishop v. United States, the District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma reached a similar conclusion about doctrinal\\n5 The Supreme Court’s affirmance of the Second Circuit’s decision in Windsor did not discuss Baker, but neither did it critique the Second Circuit’s analysis of Baker’s applicability. United States v. Windsor, 133 S. Ct. 2675 (U.S. 2013).\\n17\\n\\n\\x0cdevelopments since Baker and about the effect of the Supreme Court’s Windsor decision. No. 04-CV-848-TCK-TLW at *32-34 (N.D. Okla. Jan. 14, 2014) (in regards to the latter point, explaining that “statements made by the [Supreme Court] Justices [in Windsor] indicate that lower courts should be applying Windsor (and not Baker) to the logical ‘next issue’ of state prohibitions of same-sex marriage. . . . If Baker is binding, lower courts would have no reason to apply or distinguish Windsor, and all this judicial hand-wringing over how lower courts should apply Windsor would be superfluous.”). Although not binding on this Court, the reasoning in these cases is persuasive, and the Court need not repeat their full discussion of these issues here.\\nKitchen acknowledges that some federal courts have recently treated Baker as controlling precedent. For example, the First Circuit found Baker to be binding precedent because it had not yet been repudiated by the Supreme Court. Massachusetts v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 682 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 2012), cert. denied, 133 S. Ct. 2884 (U.S. 2013) and 133 S. Ct. 2887 (U.S. 2013). However, the First Circuit did not even discuss the doctrinal developments exception. The District Court for the District of Nevada also found Baker controlling, seeming to suggest that even if doctrinal developments had occurred since a case was handed down, that case was nonetheless binding until the Supreme Court stated otherwise. Sevcik v. Sandoval, 911 F. Supp. 2d 996, 1002 (D. Nev. 2012).6 Both cases preceded the Supreme Court’s decision in Windsor, a decision which, as explained above, showed additional doctrinal development in relevant jurisprudence. The Court disagrees with the analysis of doctrinal developments conducted in those two cases and accordingly finds that Baker is not binding on the current case and does not justify abstention here.\\n6 However, the district court acknowledged that “the present equal protection claim is precluded by Baker insofar as the claim does not rely on the Romer line of cases, and Defendants are entitled to dismissal in part, accordingly.” Id. at 1003. The court, in essence, treated Romer as a new doctrinal development.\\n18\\n\\n\\x0cIn summary, the Court reserves ruling on the issue of whether the existing Defendants are sufficient to bind state authorities and all county clerks should a ruling on the merits be made in favor of Plaintiffs. In all other regards, Defendant Clerks’ arguments regarding abstention are rejected.\\nIV. Failure to State a Claim Defendant McCormick argues very briefly in her motion to dismiss that Plaintiffs’ Complaint should be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. She argues that because there is no controlling case law that invalidates West Virginia’s marriage ban, Plaintiffs have failed to sufficiently plead a claim for relief. The Court rejects this argument. There is no requirement that a court with controlling jurisdiction have already invalidated a state’s same-sex marriage ban in order for a plaintiff to have sufficiently pled that a state’s marriage ban is unconstitutional. Defendant McCormick’s cursory suggestion that the state ban is rationally related to a legitimate government interest and is presumptively constitutional may be a valid defense, but it does not render Plaintiffs’ claims insufficient as a matter of law. Plaintiffs have met their burden at this stage. Defendant Clerks have reserved the right to file subsequent motions to dismiss addressing other grounds for dismissal. Thus, the Court at this time declines to dismiss the case for failure to state a claim.\\nV. Standing to Challenge the Non-Recognition Statute The State of West Virginia has also filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that Plaintiffs do not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of West Virginia’s marriage non-recognition statute, found at West Virginia Code Section 48-2-603.7 State’s Mot. Dismiss, ECF No. 34.8\\n7 As discussed above, this section prohibits a same-sex marriage performed outside of West Virginia from being recognized as a valid marriage within West Virginia:\\n19\\n\\n\\x0cBecause Plaintiffs lack standing, Defendant argues, the Court does not have subject-matter\\njurisdiction with regard to the claims under Section 48-2-603 and should therefore dismiss those\\nclaims.\\nStanding requires that the following three elements be met: 1) “the plaintiff must have\\nsuffered an injury in fact—an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and\\nparticularized and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical;” 2) “there must be a\\ncausal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of—the injury has to be fairly\\n. . . trace[able] to the challenged action of the defendant, and not . . . th[e] result [of] the\\nindependent action of some third party not before the court;” and 3) “it must be likely, as\\nopposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.” Lujan\\nv. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992) (alternation in original) (footnote omitted)\\n(citations omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted). In regard to the first prong, the Supreme\\nCourt has explained that “[b]y particularized, [it] mean[s] that the injury must affect the plaintiff in a personal and individual way.” Id. at 560 n.1.\\nDefendant argues that Plaintiffs have not pled an injury that results from the operation of\\nSection 48-2-603. Plaintiff couples clearly allege a desire to get married in West Virginia and\\nthat they are legally qualified to do so if not for the fact they each couple is same-sex. Compl. ¶\\n“A public act, record or judicial proceeding of any other state, territory, possession or tribe respecting a relationship between persons of the same sex that is treated as a marriage under the laws of the other state, territory, possession, or tribe, or a right or claim arising from such relationship, shall not be given effect by this state.” W. Va. Code § 48-2-603. 8 This argument is the only one raised in the State’s Motion to Dismiss. The State does not otherwise join in the grounds for dismissal discussed in the other two motions to dismiss. Neither does the State claim that Plaintiffs lack standing to challenge the other components of the West Virginia marriage ban.\\n20\\n\\n\\x0c21 (“But for the fact that they are of the same sex, each Plaintiff couple is legally qualified to marry under the laws of West Virginia and wishes to marry in the State.”). The Complaint also states that each couple attempted to obtain a marriage license in West Virginia but that their requests were denied. Id. ¶¶ 22, 23, 24. However, Defendant argues that allegations regarding marriage outside of West Virginia are missing from the Complaint:\\nPlaintiffs do not allege that they have valid marriages from other jurisdictions, that they have taken any steps to obtain valid marriages from other jurisdictions, that they intend to be married in other jurisdictions, or that they would have obtained a valid marriage from another jurisdiction if West Virginia recognized out-of-state same-sex marriages. Indeed, they do not even allege that they meet the qualifications to be married in any other jurisdiction. State’s Mot. Dismiss 5. In reviewing the Complaint, the Court is led to the same conclusion. Plaintiffs do not allege an intent or desire to marry elsewhere if that marriage would be recognized in West Virginia. Neither do they allege that they legally are qualified to do so. The closest that the Complaint comes to such an allegation is the statement that “the adult Plaintiffs and other samesex couples . . . are also denied the ability to have a valid marriage from another jurisdiction recorded or recognized in West Virginia.” Compl. ¶ 26. Attached to Plaintiffs’ response to the State’s motion to dismiss are declarations from the adult Plaintiffs, some of whom explain that they would marry in another state if they knew that West Virginia would recognize that out-of-state marriage. See, e.g., Decl. Casie McGee ¶ 15, ECF No. 39-1 (“[W]e would marry in another state if we thought we could have our marriage respected and recognized here at home [in West Virginia].”). The Court must determine whether it can consider these declarations for purposes of ruling on the State’s motion to dismiss. The Supreme Court has explained in which situations additional evidence can be considered on a challenge to subject-matter jurisdiction:\\n21\\n\\n\\x0c[A] defendant may challenge subject matter jurisdiction in one of two ways. See Adams v. Bain, 697 F.2d 1213, 1219 (4th Cir. 1982). First, the defendant may contend “that a complaint simply fails to allege facts upon which subject matter jurisdiction can be based.” Id. When a defendant makes a facial challenge to subject matter jurisdiction, “the plaintiff, in effect, is afforded the same procedural protection as he would receive under a Rule 12(b)(6) consideration.” Id. In that situation, the facts alleged in the complaint are taken as true, and the motion must be denied if the complaint alleges sufficient facts to invoke subject matter jurisdiction.\\nIn the alternative, the defendant can contend . . . “that the jurisdictional allegations of the complaint [are] not true.” Adams, 697 F.2d at 1219. The plaintiff in this latter situation is afforded less procedural protection: If the defendant challenges the factual predicate of subject matter jurisdiction, “[a] trial court may then go beyond the allegations of the complaint and in an evidentiary hearing determine if there are facts to support the jurisdictional allegations,” without converting the motion to a summary judgment proceeding. Id. (emphasis added). In that situation, the presumption of truthfulness normally accorded a complaint’s allegations does not apply, and the district court is entitled to decide disputed issues of fact with respect to subject matter jurisdiction.\\nKerns v. United States, 585 F.3d 187, 192 (4th Cir. 2009) (emphasis in original).\\nDefendant is not arguing that Plaintiffs’ allegations in the Complaint are not true. Rather,\\nDefendant argues that Plaintiffs have not sufficiently alleged an injury caused by Section 48-2-\\n603. Therefore, Defendant’s attack falls into the first sort of challenge noted above. Accordingly,\\nwhile the allegations in the Complaint will be taken as true, the declarations attached to\\nPlaintiffs’ response will not be considered at this point. The Court will only rely on the\\nallegations in the Complaint when deciding the State’s motion to dismiss.\\nHaving determined what evidence will be considered, the Court now examines whether\\nstanding is met here. The Ninth Circuit addressed the issue of standing in Smelt v. County of\\nOrange, 447 F.3d 673 (9th Cir. 2006). In that case, a California same-sex couple challenged\\nSection 2 of DOMA, under which no state was required to recognize any same-sex marriage\\n22\\n\\n\\x0centered into in another state.9 The Ninth Circuit found that the couple lacked standing because\\n“[n]o state has determined that Smelt and Hammer are married.” Id. at 683. It elaborated that\\n“[w]ere they to change their residence to Massachusetts [the only state at that time which\\nallowed same-sex marriage], their situation might change, but they have placed nothing before us\\nto suggest that they have gone, or intend to go, to that state.” Id. (footnote omitted). Therefore,\\n“while Section 2 may affect someone who has been declared married in some state, Smelt and\\nHammer do not come within that category of people.” Id.; see also Walker v. Barbour, No.\\nCIV.A. 3:08CV96TSLJC, 2009 WL 691972, at *2 (S.D. Miss. Mar. 12, 2009) (finding no\\nstanding to challenge Section 2 of DOMA for same reason).\\nPlaintiffs’ attempts to re-cast the reasoning of Smelt are unpersuasive. They argue that the\\ncouple in Smelt lacked standing because marriage for that couple was an impossibility unless\\nthey moved to Massachusetts. The Court disagrees. The Ninth Circuit made it clear that the\\ncouple lacked standing because they neither were married nor alleged an intent to marry\\nelsewhere. Plaintiffs point out that Section 2 of DOMA was permissive—simply providing that a\\nstate could not be forced to recognize same-sex marriages—but that point does not change Smelt’s parallel to the instant case.10\\n9 Section 2 of DOMA states: “No State, territory, or possession of the United States, or Indian tribe, shall be required to give effect to any public act, record, or judicial proceeding of any other State, territory, possession, or tribe respecting a relationship between persons of the same sex that is treated as a marriage under the laws of such other State, territory, possession, or tribe, or a right or claim arising from such relationship.”\\n28 U.S.C. § 1738C. 10 The Court relies on Smelt solely for the Ninth Circuit’s discussion that standing was lacking because the plaintiffs were not married in another state nor pled their intent to marry in another state. The Court is not adopting the reasoning found in other portions of the opinion.\\n23\\n\\n\\x0cPlaintiffs argue that they are not required to marry outside of West Virginia and then seek to have that marriage recognized in West Virginia in order to have standing because those efforts would be futile. It is clear that were Plaintiffs to attempt to have an out-of-state marriage recognized in West Virginia, that request would be denied, and Defendants do not argue otherwise. The Supreme Court discussed futility in MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 549 U.S. 118 (2007), noting that the touchstone for determining whether a threatened plaintiff has standing to challenge actions by the government or private parties—without first exposing himself or herself to liability by engaging in certain behavior—is coercion. For example:\\n[W]here threatened action by government is concerned, we do not require a plaintiff to expose himself to liability before bringing suit to challenge the basis for the threat—for example, the constitutionality of a law threatened to be enforced. The plaintiff’s own action (or inaction) in failing to violate the law eliminates the imminent threat of prosecution, but nonetheless does not eliminate Article III jurisdiction. Id. at 128-29 (emphasis in original). In other words, where “the plaintiff had eliminated the imminent threat of harm by simply not doing what he claimed the right to do . . . [t]hat did not preclude subject-matter jurisdiction because the threat-eliminating behavior was effectively coerced.” Id. at 129. Thus, a court will not require a plaintiff to engage in behavior that could risk criminal sanctions or great personal or business loss before challenging the constitutionality of a statute or the legality of certain actions. Id. at 134 (“The rule that a plaintiff must destroy a large building, bet the farm, or (as here) risk treble damages and the loss of 80 percent of its business before seeking a declaration of its actively contested legal rights finds no support in Article III.” (footnote omitted)). Plaintiffs cite this case in support of their futility argument, but the Court does not find MedImmune to be supportive. Here, Plaintiffs do not risk criminal sanctions or personal ruination if they are married in another state and then seek to have that marriage recognized here.\\n24\\n\\n\\x0cAlthough obtaining an out-of-state marriage will entail some time and personal cost and a West Virginia clerk’s refusal to recognize the marriage may result in embarrassment, sadness, or anger, these are not the sorts of risks that suggest that Plaintiffs are “coerced” into not seeking a marriage out-of-state.\\nThe Supreme Court also discussed the issue of futility in Babbitt v. United Farm Workers National Union, where a farmworkers’ union sought to challenge Arizona’s statutory procedures for agricultural workers to elect bargaining representatives, arguing “that the statutory election procedures frustrate rather than facilitate democratic selection of bargaining representatives.” 442 U.S. 289, 300 (1979). Although the union “declined to pursue those procedures [before filing suit] . . . due to the procedures’ asserted futility,” the Supreme Court nonetheless found that the union had standing to challenge the procedures. Id. The Court noted that the union “has in the past sought to represent Arizona farmworkers and has asserted in its complaint a desire to organize such workers and to represent them in collective bargaining.” Id. This indicates that the standing analysis rested at least in part on the union’s pleading in the complaint of a desire to engage in election activities should the barriers creating futility be eliminated.\\nPlaintiffs also point to the Supreme Court’s discrimination jurisprudence. In employment discrimination cases, for example, a plaintiff is not necessarily required to actually apply for a job with a discriminatory employer in order to recover for discrimination because “[w]hen a person’s desire for a job is not translated into a formal application solely because of his unwillingness to engage in a futile gesture he is as much a victim of discrimination as is he who goes through the motions of submitting an application.” Int’l Bhd. of Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 365-66 (1977). However, “[b]ecause he is necessarily claiming that he was deterred from applying for the job by the employer’s discriminatory practices, his is the not\\n25\\n\\n\\x0calways easy burden of proving that he would have applied for the job had it not been for those practices.” Id. at 367-68.\\nThe Court finds that even if a certain activity is futile, a plaintiff must nonetheless demonstrate willingness to engage in the activity were it not for a barrier in place that makes the activity futile. Just as a plaintiff alleging employment discrimination must allege that he or she would have applied for the job but for the discrimination, and just as a union must allege that it would invoke electoral procedures were those procedures not ineffective, so too must Plaintiffs here allege that they would indeed get married in another state but for the fact that West Virginia does not recognize those out-of-state same-sex marriages. Plaintiffs have failed to so allege. Therefore, the Court finds that Plaintiffs lack constitutional standing to challenge West Virginia Code Section 48-2-603.\\nHaving found that standing is lacking, the Court need not reach the State’s arguments about prudential standing. However, it is necessary to address a few other arguments that Plaintiffs bring up in support of their alleged standing. Plaintiffs argue that allowing them to only challenge the statute prohibiting in-state same-sex marriages—but not the non-recognition statute—would subject same-sex couples to an impermissible burden should the Court in fact strike down the in-state same-sex marriage ban. In that situation, it may be that if Plaintiffs wanted to be recognized as married in West Virginia, they would have to be married in the state itself rather than alternatively going outside of the state and then having the marriage recorded here—a burden which different-sex couples do not face. Plaintiffs point to no authority, and the Court has not found any, showing that this argument confers standing which otherwise would not lie, however. Plaintiffs also argue that if the non-recognition statute stands while the other components of the marriage ban are struck down, they will constantly be forced to provide proof\\n26\\n\\n\\x0cthat they were married within the state, as opposed to another state, in order to have their marriage given its due respect within West Virginia. However, this injury is too conjectural and speculative to create an injury. There is no evidence that somebody inquiring into Plaintiffs’ marital status—for example, a hospital administrator inquiring into spousal health insurance coverage—would actually ask for this proof.\\nAdditionally, Plaintiffs argue that their claims as to the non-recognition statute should continue because all of the statutes comprising the marriage ban together harm Plaintiffs’ dignitary interests. This point is not sufficient to confer standing where it is otherwise lacking. Lastly, Plaintiffs argue that the statutes comprising the marriage ban were all passed with the same discriminatory animus and therefore the entire marriage ban must proceed to adjudication on the merits. This consideration, however, does not factor into the standing analysis. Furthermore, even if the non-recognition statute remained in place, it would not prevent Plaintiffs from receiving relief with regards to the other portions of the West Virginia marriage ban—namely, if the other portions of the marriage ban were struck down, Plaintiffs would be able to get married in West Virginia even if the non-recognition statute remained.\\nThe Court acknowledges that it would be preferable to adjudicate the constitutionality of the entire same-sex marriage ban in one case as opposed to two, in terms of efficiency and because of the overlap in the analysis that would surely occur. Those considerations, however, do not excuse Plaintiffs from the requirement to demonstrate standing. Accordingly, the Court grants the State of West Virginia’s motion to dismiss, and dismisses from the case all claims that relate to West Virginia Code Section 48-2-603. Plaintiffs may proceed in challenging other portions of the marriage ban.11\\n11 The Court clarifies that this dismissal is without prejudice. Should Plaintiffs desire to amend 27\\n\\n\\x0cVI. Motion to Amend Deadline In an Order dated January 17, 2014, the Court directed that Defendants’ responses to Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment would be due seven days after the entry of a Memorandum Opinion and Order resolving the motions to dismiss. ECF No. 52. The State has filed a motion to amend that deadline, asking that all Defendants have until February 7, 2014, or seven days after resolution of the motions to dismiss, whichever is later, to respond to Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment. ECF No. 53. The State noted that Plaintiffs would not agree to this amendment unless Defendants entered into a compressed schedule for remaining filings. Although Plaintiffs have the opportunity to amend the Complaint and/or join additional parties as outlined in this Memorandum Opinion and Order, the Court is inclined to nonetheless allow briefing to proceed regarding Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment. For reasons appearing to the Court, the Court directs that Defendants shall have 14 days from entry of this Memorandum Opinion and Order to file any responses to Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment. The State’s motion to amend the deadline is accordingly denied as moot. At the same time, however, the Court notes that short extensions like that requested by the State are routinely granted, as they do not create unnecessary or extraordinary delay. All parties are advised to be mindful of professional courtesy should requests for extensions arise in the future.\\nVII. Conclusion For the reasons stated above, the motion to strike (ECF No. 45) is GRANTED in part; the Court will consider the two exhibits attached to Plaintiffs’ notice of supplemental authority but will not consider legal argument presented in the memorandum accompanying those exhibits. The Court DENIES in part Defendant Clerks’ motions to dismiss (ECF Nos. 26, 31) and\\nthe Complaint to reassert their claims regarding the non-recognition statute, they must do so by the same date outlined in the discussion of abstention, that is, by February 12, 2014.\\n28\\n\\n\\x0cRESERVES ruling as to abstention arising from the issue of whether the existing Defendants are sufficient to bind state authorities and all county clerks, should a ruling on the merits be made in favor of Plaintiffs. The Court DIRECTS Plaintiffs, by February 12, 2014, to either 1) seek joinder of whatever additional parties they deem necessary to create greater certainty as to the effect of a ruling in this case, or 2) file a responsive pleading explaining why the existing Defendants in this lawsuit are sufficient to bind state authorities and all county clerks should a ruling on the merits be made in favor of Plaintiffs and why joinder of additional parties is not necessary. Defendants may file a response within seven days of Plaintiffs taking either action, and Plaintiffs may file a reply within three days of any response from Defendants.\\nThe Court GRANTS the State’s motion to dismiss (ECF No. 34) and accordingly DISMISSES Plaintiffs’ claims pertaining to West Virginia Code Section 48-2-603 (the nonrecognition provision); Plaintiffs’ claims as to the other portions of the marriage ban may proceed. However, the Court ORDERS that Plaintiffs may amend their Complaint by February 12, 2014. Lastly, the Court ORDERS that Defendants shall have 14 days from entry of this Memorandum Opinion and Order to file any responses to Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment. The Court accordingly DENIES as moot the State’s motion to amend the deadline (ECF No. 53).\\nCourt DIRECTS the Clerk to send a copy of this written Opinion and Order to counsel of record and any unrepresented parties.\\nENTER: January 29, 2014\\n29\\n\\n\\x0c'\n",

Defendant Clerks and the State oppose the motion and the West Virginia Association of County Officials has moved to file an amicus brief in support of Defendant Clerks. For the reasons set forth below, Plaintiffs’ Motion for Attorneys’ Fees, Expenses, and Costs (ECF No. 145) is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. Plaintiffs’ Motion for Extension of Time in Which to File Reply in Support of Motion for Attorneys’ Fees, Expenses, and Costs (152) is DENIED AS MOOT. The West Virginia Association of County Officials’ Motion for Leave to File Brief of Amicus Curiae (154) is GRANTED.\\n\\n\\x0cI. Background Plaintiffs brought this action pursuant to Title 42, Section 1983 of the U.S. Code to challenge West Virginia’s ban on same-sex marriage. Plaintiffs, three same-sex couples and a minor child, sued Karen S. Cole, in her official capacity as Cabell County Clerk, and Vera J. McCormick, in her official capacity as Kanawha County Clerk. County clerks are responsible for issuing marriage licenses in their respective counties and recording marriages that take place outside of West Virginia. They are responsible for ensuring that marriage licenses comply with state law, including, at the time this suit was filed, West Virginia’s ban on same-sex marriage. The Plaintiff couples in this case each sought a marriage license from one of the clerks, and each was denied. Accordingly, they filed this suit seeking declaratory relief, asking the Court to declare as unconstitutional West Virginia Code Sections 48-2-104, 48-2-401, and 48-2-603, and all other sources of West Virginia law prohibiting same-sex marriage. Section 48-2-104 dictates the contents of a state marriage license, Section 48-2-401 governs persons authorized to perform marriages, and Section 48-2-603 prohibits recognition of same-sex marriages executed in other states. Plaintiffs also sought an injunction to prohibit Defendant Clerks from enforcing these laws. The State of West Virginia intervened in the case to defend the constitutionality of its laws. Defendant Clerks and the State each filed a motion to dismiss. The Court denied the Clerks’ motions. The Court found that Plaintiffs did not have standing to challenge the non-recognition statute, and thus granted the State’s motion to dismiss. This resulted in dismissal of Plaintiffs’ claim challenging West Virginia Code Section 48-2-603. See ECF No. 56. Plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment on their remaining claims. Defendant Clerks and the State then filed their own motions for summary judgment. The State also filed a second motion to dismiss. The Court stayed the case pending a decision from the U.S. Circuit\\n-2-\\n\\n\\x0cCourt of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Bostic v. Schaefer, a case challenging Virginia’s ban on same-sex marriage. After the Fourth Circuit held that Virginia’s ban was unconstitutional, the Court lifted the stay in the present case and granted Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment. The Court denied Defendants’ and the State’s motions for summary judgment, and denied the State’s motion to dismiss. The Court declared Sections 48-2-104 and 48-2-401 unconstitutional in so far as they prohibited same-sex marriage. The Court also enjoined Defendant Clerks from enforcing these statutes to the extent that they were declared unconstitutional. See ECF No. 139. Thereafter, Plaintiffs moved for attorneys’ fees and costs.\\nII. Statement of the Law Under the “American Rule,” parties generally bear their own fees and costs. Key Tronic Corp. v. United States, 511 U.S. 809, 815 (1994). Congress has, however, carved out several exceptions to this rule through fee-shifting statutes. One such statute is the Civil Rights Attorney’s Fees Award Act, also known as Section 1988, which provides that in a civil rights action brought under Section 1983, “the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney’s fee as part of the costs.” 42 U.S.C. § 1988(b) (2012). “[A] prevailing plaintiff ‘should ordinarily recover an attorney’s fee unless special circumstances would render such an award unjust.’” Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 429 (1983) (quoting S. Rep. No. 94–1011, at 4 (1976)). Where the prevailing party seeks an attorneys’ fee “so outrageously excessive so as to shock the conscience of the court . . . a complete denial of any fee award is justified.” Fair Housing Council of Greater Washington v. Landow, 999 F.2d 92, 94 (4th Cir. 1993). Barring these or other rare circumstances, attorneys’ fees should be granted to compensate the successful attorneys and “‘ensure effective access to the judicial process’ for persons with civil rights grievances.” Lefemine v. Wideman, 758 F.3d 551, 555 (4th\\n-3-\\n\\n\\x0cCir. 2014) (quoting Hensley, 461 U.S. at 429). A. Calculation of Fee To calculate a reasonable fee, the Court must follow a three-step process: First, the court must determine the lodestar figure by multiplying the number of reasonable hours expended times a reasonable rate. Second, the court must subtract fees for hours spent on unsuccessful claims unrelated to successful ones. [Third], the court should award some percentage of the remaining amount, depending on the degree of success enjoyed by the plaintiff.\\nJones v. Southpeak Interactive Corp. of Delaware, 777 F.3d 658, 675-76 (4th Cir. 2015) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\\nTurning first to the lodestar calculation, the Court must determine a reasonable number of hours spent on the case and a reasonable rate for each attorney involved. The party requesting attorneys’ fees bears the burden of producing evidence of the hours expended. Hensley, 461 U.S. at 433. Where the prevailing attorneys have failed to adequately document their hours, the Court may reduce the fee award. Id. Attorneys should use “billing judgment” when requesting fees. Id. at 434. “[H]ours that are excessive, redundant, or otherwise unnecessary” should be excluded. Id.\\nWhether certain hours are reasonable is often highly dependent on the nature of the issues litigated. In some cases, attorneys may reasonably request fees for hours spent on public relations, including press conferences and media appearances. In an employment discrimination action, for example, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit allowed fees for hours spent on public relations in an attempt to convince the defendants to negotiate a consent decree. Davis v. City & County of San Francisco, 976 F.2d 1536, 1545 (9th Cir. 1992), vacated in part on other grounds, 984 F.2d 345 (1993). The court held: “Where the giving of press conferences and performance of other lobbying and public relations work is directly and intimately related to the\\n-4-\\n\\n\\x0csuccessful representation of a client, private attorneys do such work and bill their clients. Prevailing civil rights plaintiffs may do the same.” Id. Where public relations work does not directly impact litigation but serves some other purpose, such hours are not reasonable and will not be included in the lodestar calculation. See Rum Creek Coal Sales, Inc. v. Caperton, 31 F.3d 169, 176 (4th Cir. 1994) (affirming disallowance of fees for hours spent on press and publicity work where attorneys’ efforts were intended to mitigate public relations damage to the plaintiff corporation).\\nReasonable rates “are to be calculated according to the prevailing market rates in the relevant community, regardless of whether plaintiff is represented by private or nonprofit counsel.” Blum v. Stenson, 465 U.S. 886, 895 (1984). The prevailing party must produce evidence, in addition to affidavits of the party’s own attorneys, demonstrating that the rates requested correspond to “those prevailing in the community for similar services by lawyers of reasonably comparable skill, experience and reputation.” Id. at 895 n. 11. The relevant community is the one in which the court sits. Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n v. Hanson, 859 F.2d 313, 317 (4th Cir. 1988). In certain cases, however, where the nature of the litigation indicates that no attorney with the specialized skills required is available in the community, different rates may be reasonable. See id. There are “two questions to be asked in determining whether an exception to the general rule should be granted: are services of like quality truly available in the locality where the services are rendered; and did the party choosing the attorney from elsewhere act reasonably in making that choice?” Id. Once the Court has determined a reasonable rate for each attorney, the Court must multiply this figure by the number of hours reasonably expended to calculate the lodestar.\\nA plaintiff need not succeed on all her claims to be awarded attorneys’ fees. See Hensley,\\n-5-\\n\\n\\x0c461 U.S. at 433. This brings the Court to the second step in the calculation, reducing the lodestar to reflect unsuccessful claims. See Jones, 777 F.3d at 676. There is no precise formula for making this reduction. Hensley, 461 U.S. at 436. The Court may not simply decrease the fee award by the percentage of Plaintiff’s claims that were unsuccessful. Jones, 777 F.3d at 676. Rather, the Court “may attempt to identify specific hours that should be eliminated, or it may simply reduce the award to account for the limited success.” Hensley, 461 U.S. at 436-37.\\nThe third and final step in the calculation is equally imprecise. The Court must determine what percentage of the calculated fee to award based on “the degree of success obtained.” Id. at 436. The Supreme Court has identified the measure of Plaintiff’s success as the “the most critical factor” to the overall computation of a reasonable fee award. Id. The Court must consider the relief obtained compared to the relief initially sought by the plaintiff. McAfee v. Boczar, 738 F.3d 81, 93 (4th Cir. 2013). The Court should “reduce the award if ‘the relief, however significant, is limited in comparison to the scope of the litigation as a whole.’” Id. at 92 (quoting Hensley, 461 U.S. at 439-40).\\nB. Distribution of Fee Once the Court has calculated a reasonable fee, it must next determine how to distribute liability for the fee among the defendants. The distribution of fees in this case turns on whether the suit is properly considered an Ex parte Young case against the state of West Virginia, or rather one against Cabell and Kanawha counties. Under the doctrine of Ex parte Young, a plaintiff may challenge the constitutionality of a state law or local ordinance, policy, or custom by bringing suit against an official, in her official capacity, for enforcing or administering that law or rule. Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 155-56 (1908). If the plaintiff succeeds, any judgment against the official in her official capacity\\n-6-\\n\\n\\x0c“imposes liability on the entity that [s]he represents.” Brandon v. Holt, 469 U.S. 464, 471 (1985). This rule applies to attorneys’ fees as well as any judgment on the merits. See id. at 472. Moreover, contrary to the State’s argument in this case, this rule applies equally to states and local entities. In Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678 (1978), the Supreme Court held that “Congress undoubtedly intended to . . . authorize fee awards payable by the States when their officials are sued in their official capacities.” Hutto, 437 U.S. at 693-94; see West Virginians for Life, Inc. v. Smith, 952 F. Supp. 342, 348 n. 4 (S.D. W. Va. 1996) (“A § 1988 fee award against a state officer sued in his official capacity imposes liability on the state.”). The Court explained that a state properly sued through a state official in an Ex parte Young action has no immunity from subsequent fees awarded under Section 1988. Hutto, 437 U.S. at 696-98. Accordingly, although fees awarded in an Ex parte Young action are assessed against the defendant official, they are ultimately the responsibility the state or local entity on whose behalf the official acts. Id. It is thus necessary to determine the entity that a defendant official represents in order to identify the entity that will be responsible for attorneys’ fees.\\nAlthough the defendant clerks here are, in name, county officials, such officials are sometimes considered state agents for purposes of a specific case. Several courts have held that local and county officials may be considered state officials for purposes of an Ex parte Young suit where they are responsible for enforcing or administering state law rather than local or county policies. In Bostic v. Schaefer, 760 F.3d 352 (4th Cir. 2014), same-sex couples challenged Virginia’s same-sex marriage ban by suing, among others, a city clerk who had denied one of the couples a marriage license. Bostic, 760 F.3d at 367, 371. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that the clerk was a proper defendant through which to sue the state of Virginia under Ex parte Young because he was responsible for enforcing Virginia’s same-sex marriage ban.\\n-7-\\n\\n\\x0cSee id. at 371 & n. 3. The Court explained that the clerk’s action in denying the plaintiffs’ application for a marriage license was “clearly attributable to the state.” Id. at 371 n. 2. The U.S. Courts of Appeals for the Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Circuits have also held that a county or local official may be properly considered an agent of the state where that official is sued for enforcing a state law, rather than a discretionary rule or local policy. See Brotherton v. Cleveland, 173 F.3d 552, 566 (6th Cir. 1999) (“Where county officials are sued simply for complying with state mandates that afford no discretion, they act as an arm of the State.”); Bethesda Lutheran Homes and Servs., Inc. v. Leean, 154 F.3d 716, 718 (7th Cir. 1998) (explaining that where a municipality is forced to follow an unconstitutional state law, it is the state law and not the municipality that is responsible for the plaintiff’s injury); Echols v. Parker, 909 F.2d 795, 801 (5th Cir. 1990) (“[W]hen a state statute directs the actions of an official, as here, the officer, be he state or local, is acting as a state official.”).\\nThus, if the Court finds that Defendant Clerks were sued for enforcing West Virginia state law they may properly be considered state officials for purposes of this matter. As such, any fees awarded would be assessed against the clerks in their official capacities, to be paid by the State of West Virginia. If the Court instead finds that the clerks were sued for administering a county rule or policy, they would properly be considered agents of their respective counties, not of the State. In that case, it is the counties and not the State that would be liable for the judgment and any attorneys’ fees assessed against the clerks. Brandon, 469 U.S. at 472; see also Monell v. New York City Dep’t of Social Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 690, 694 (1978) (explaining that local government entities are liable under Section 1983 where local policy or custom causes injury).\\n-8-\\n\\n\\x0cIII. Discussion A. Calculation of Fee Plaintiffs seek $342,576.25 in attorneys’ fees for 1,033.25 hours, including 74.1 hours of paralegal time. Defendant Clerks strongly oppose Plaintiffs’ request. They argue that several special circumstances justify denying a fee award altogether. First, they claim that Plaintiffs’ proposed fee is so excessive as to shock the conscience. They also argue that they have done no wrong but were merely fulfilling their duty as officers of the state. Furthermore, the clerks contend that filing this action was unnecessary given that Virginia’s same-sex marriage case “would unquestionably be decided and appealed to the Fourth Circuit long before this action progressed past its infancy.” They also claim that this lawsuit was “manufactured” by Plaintiffs’ counsel. Finally, Defendant Clerks argue that imposition of attorneys’ fees on the clerks and their respective counties is inherently unjust because they were not responsible for enacting the challenged laws. ECF No. 153 The State also challenges the fee request, arguing that no fee is reasonable in this case because “[s]ame-sex marriage is a changing area of law” and “[t]here was no question of constitutionality” when the same-sex marriage ban was passed. Thus “it would be unfair and unjust to require payment of fees by state and county officials acting in good faith” to enforce the ban. ECF No. 155. An impressive battalion of lawyers, eleven attorneys from three firms, ably represented Plaintiffs to successfully prosecute an important civil rights claim, for their benefit and that of many other West Virginians. One of many cases cascading from the United States Supreme Court’s decision in United States v. Windsor, 133 S. Ct. 2675 (2013), this action resulted in a significant victory for Plaintiffs, though the tide of success in other states, the Circuit, and\\n-9-\\n\\n\\x0cultimately the Supreme Court surely helped carry them. Although same-sex marriage was a changing area of law when this case was filed, and Plaintiffs’ counsel sought out plaintiffs in West Virginia to file this suit, this case constitutes a proper suit under Section 1983 to vindicate Plaintiffs’ civil rights and overturn unconstitutional legislation. That the clerks and the State acted in good faith in enforcing this legislation is irrelevant. See Lefemine, 758 F.3d at 557 (“[W]e, and our sister circuits, have repeatedly rejected good faith as a special circumstance justifying the denial of Section 1988 attorneys’ fees.”). Furthermore, the fee requested is not so extreme as to shock the conscience and warrant the denial of attorneys’ fees. The Court thus finds that Plaintiffs are entitled to an award of fees and costs. The Court also finds, however, that the hourly rates sought and total hours expended are excessive.\\nFirst, the Court finds that some of Plaintiffs’ attorneys are not entitled to the hourly rates they submitted. This Court is obligated to apply local market rates unless some circumstance justifies looking to a different or larger market. Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n, 859 F.2d at 317. Though each attorney provided some support for the rates each seeks, those rates are well above the relevant market within which this Court sits. Lawyers from the two nationally recognized firms of Jenner and Block and Lambda Legal chose to search for plaintiffs and venues in West Virginia to bring this action. While it is admirable that these firms initiated this civil rights litigation and brought to it a level of expertise and stature that may not have been available from in-state firms, the fact remains that they sought out West Virginia plaintiffs and a West Virginia forum. They were not sought out by state residents who found it difficult to obtain representation for these claims in West Virginia. They should not expect hourly rates to be based upon rates from large metropolitan markets, such as their home cities, or schedules like the Laffey Matrix. Therefore,\\n-10-\\n\\n\\x0cthe Court will consider its knowledge of, and experience with, reasonable attorneys’ fees and hourly rates within this market.\\nThe attorneys with Jenner and Block contributed a substantial portion of the total hours, through four attorneys. In his affidavit in support of Jenner and Block attorneys, Mr. Smith relies on the Laffey Matrix1 and points out that the firm’s usual rates for these attorneys is even higher. The Matrix is updated annually, and new rates began on June 1, 2014. Mr. Smith submitted 22.5 hours at hourly rates of $771 and $789, covering the periods before and after June 1, 2014. His credentials were impressive and command a high hourly rate. His firm was primarily responsible for drafting most of the pleadings and submissions, in particular the briefing on summary judgment and other dispositive motions, which comprised the bulk of the work performed in the case as there was no discovery. Ms. Harrison, an experienced litigator with Jenner and Block, contributed over ninety hours and supervised the work of two associates, Mr. McCotter and Mr. Tarasen. She seeks an hourly rate of $567 through June 1, 2014, and $655 thereafter. Mr. McCotter worked 95.5 hours and Mr. Tarasen 147.75 hours, each at hourly rates of $320 and $328.\\nWhile the Matrix serves a useful purpose, its applicability in this market is limited. This Court has contemporaneously determined hourly rates in other cases, and considered hourly rates set by colleagues in the state and federal courts in this area. The Court sets Mr. Smith’s rate as $500 per hour; this rate coincides with a highly competent, experienced senior litigator’s rates and reflects the more limited role of Mr. Smith in this case. For Ms. Harrison, the Court fixes an hourly rate of $400, commensurate with an experienced and seasoned litigator managing\\n1 The Laffey Matrix is a “schedule of attorneys’ fees, first developed based on information about the prevailing rates charged by federal litigators in the District of Columbia” which is updated annually based on the Consumer Price Index. Rooths v. District of Columbia, 802 F. Supp. 2d 56, 61 (D.D.C. 2011). Federal courts in the District of Columbia use it as a starting point in setting attorneys’ fees. Id. at 62. -11-\\n\\n\\x0csubordinate staff. For the associates, each with less than five years of experience, the hourly rate of $250 is awarded. Since all of the work was performed between mid-2013 and spring 2015, the Court sees no need to apply any different rates or adjustments. Jenner and Block also seeks $175 per hour for paralegal time; the Court sets a rate of $100 per hour, consistent with the local market.\\nTurning to the Lambda Legal attorneys, their work was also substantial, totaling over 400 hours. Lambda Legal has considerable experience in this particular area of civil rights, serving as advocates for gay and lesbian rights. Its three lawyers assigned here—Ms. Taylor, Ms. Loewy, and Ms. Littrell—ask for hourly rates of $350, $325, and $300, respectively. Considering their length of experience and specific expertise, and the nature of their responsibilities in this matter, the Court reduces their hourly rates to $325, $300, and $275, respectively.\\nFinally, the Court addresses the fees requested by the Tinney Law Firm. Led primarily by John Tinney, Jr., the firm used four attorneys for a variety of purposes, contributing about 150 hours at rates from $205 to $300 per hour. The firm’s paralegal also spent 60.6 hours on the case, seeking a rate of $100 per hour, which is typical. Mr. Tinney has been engaged in complex litigation throughout this state for twenty years, and enjoys a solid representation. His associate, Ms. Kittredge, is less experienced, but seeks the lower rate of $225 per hour. The Court approves the rates he seeks for his firm.\\nAs the Court understands its duty, it must determine the lodestar figure by multiplying these hourly rates times the number of hours reasonably expended. This task is more difficult; the Court always hesitates to question, much less reject, a lawyer’s statement of the time spent representing a client. Here, the Court does not doubt the time keeping performed by counsel and will not nitpick their records to exclude particular entries for duplication or redundancy. Nevertheless, the Court must adjust the fee award to reflect that more lawyers than were\\n-12-\\n\\n\\x0creasonably needed spent substantially more hours than reasonably necessary to represent Plaintiffs.\\nFirst, Plaintiffs are not entitled to the 32 hours of time attributable to press conferences and media analysis under the Rum Creek standard. See Rum Creek, 31 F.3d at 176. The Court thus subtracts 32 hours for time spent on media relations. See ECF No. 155, Ex. 16.\\nSecond, the Court observes that Plaintiffs’ attorneys rightfully point out their experience with similar cases as one of the justifications for their higher hourly rates. The fact is that several of these lawyers worked on the same issues in parallel cases brought since Windsor and on related issues even before that. Logically then, their prior knowledge should have helped them avoid inefficient or unnecessary work. Further, with this many relatively seasoned, senior litigators, there was little need for several lawyers to review everything prepared for Plaintiffs or filed by Defendants and the State. The constitutional challenges brought just after the Windsor decision provided a clear path and resulted in a steady stream of favorable decisions in federal and state courts, which Plaintiffs quickly forwarded on to this Court.\\nThere was no discovery, only one brief hearing, and only two rounds of substantial briefing for early motions to dismiss and later cross-motions for summary judgment. Each firm bills for a large number of hours with respect to each major activity. Apparently, each firm undertook a supervisory role in most aspects of the Plaintiffs’ case, though all of the substantive work of subordinates was already reviewed by a senior attorney. This approach strikes the Court as lawyers working by committee, rather than delineating and delegating to share the workload. Consequently, the Court reduces the lodestar amounts for each attorney to one-third.\\nNext, the Court must reduce the fee award to account for any unsuccessful claims. All parties agree that the Plaintiffs were not successful on their “non-recognition claim.” Plaintiffs\\n-13-\\n\\n\\x0cconcede that 31 hours should be subtracted from their total. ECF No. 156, Ex. 3. The Court thus\\n\\nsubtracts the 31 hours expended by Plaintiffs’ counsel on the non-recognition claim.\\n\\nThe Court’s lodestar calculations are as follows: Attorney/Paralegal Hours Requested Hours Awarded2 Rate\\n\\nTotal Fee\\n\\nPaul Smith\\n\\n22.5\\n\\n7\\n\\n$500\\n\\n$3,500\\n\\nLindsay Harrison 91.25\\n\\n29\\n\\n$400\\n\\n$11,600\\n\\nR.

Here, the Court finds that the considerations outlined in Hensley do not alter the award. The factors relating to counsels’ time, skill, experience, and relation to the clients are embodied in the Court’s determination of the lodestar. The novelty of the issues and undesirability of the case are likewise of lessened import here due to the tide of similar decisions since Windsor. The remaining factors are not materially significant. The Court must also consider the relief obtained and reduce the award if it is less than that initially sought by Plaintiffs. McAfee, 738 F.3d at 92-93. The Court has already reduced the hours in the lodestar to compensate for the time spent on Plaintiffs’ failed non-recognition claim. As to the remaining claims, Plaintiffs achieved complete success. In their complaint, Plaintiffs sought a declaration that West Virginia’s laws prohibiting same-sex marriage are unconstitutional and an injunction preventing Defendant Clerks from enforcing those laws. ECF No. 8. The Court granted Plaintiffs their requested relief. Accordingly, no further adjustment of the lodestar is appropriate.\\nB. Calculation of Costs Plaintiffs have also requested $7,679.64 in costs and expenses. The Court has reviewed the itemized cost charts and finds the request reasonable. The Court awards Plaintiffs $7,679.64 for costs and expenses. C. Distribution of Fees and Costs Plaintiffs sued the Cabell County Clerk and Kanawha County Clerk in their official capacities. The state of West Virginia then intervened to defend the constitutionality of the challenged statutes pursuant to Title 28, Section 2403(b) of the U.S. Code. Plaintiffs did not sue any state officials. To identify the entity responsible for the fees and costs in this matter, the Court must determine whether Defendant Clerks represented the State or their respective counties\\n-15-\\n\\n\\x0cat the time they denied marriage licenses to Plaintiff couples.3 See Brandon, 469 U.S. at 471.\\nThe clerks argue that they were “officers of the State of West Virginia” and were enforcing West\\nVirginia law when they denied marriage licenses to Plaintiffs. ECF No. 153. They maintain that\\nthey have done nothing more than obey “statutes enacted by the West Virginia Legislature, as the\\nduly elected representatives of the citizens of the State of West Virginia.” They contend that they\\nshould not be held liable for upholding the State’s laws. Instead, to the extent that Plaintiffs are\\nentitled to any fees, the State of West Virginia is liable and the fees “should be satisfied from the\\nState’s budget.” ECF No. 153.\\nThe State vehemently disagrees. First, the State contends that it is immune from\\nattorneys’ fees under the Eleventh Amendment because none of the three exceptions to state\\nsovereign immunity apply: the State has not waived immunity, Congress has not abrogated\\nimmunity, and Plaintiffs have not brought a proper Ex parte Young action against a state official.\\nAccording to the State, Defendant Clerks cannot be considered state officials under West Virginia\\nlaw.4 The State concedes, however, that had Plaintiffs sued a state official “there would be no\\n3 Plaintiffs argue that the State and Defendant Clerks should be held jointly and severally liable for attorneys’ fees. ECF No. 156. Although this is sometimes an appropriate approach to distributing liability for fees, it is not applicable in this case. Here, Defendant Clerks were sued in their official capacities. As such, attorneys’ fees and costs will be assessed against them in name only; they will not be held personally liable for paying those fees and costs. See West Virginians for Life, 952 F. Supp. at 348 n. 4. Instead, the government entity that the clerks represented at the time of Plaintiffs’ injury will be responsible for payment. This entity is either Cabell and Kanawha counties, or the state, but not both. Thus only one government entity will be responsible for the attorneys’ fees and costs assessed.\\n4 The State argues that Defendant Clerks cannot be considered state officials because counties are not considered arms of the state under West Virginia law. Regardless of how West Virginia classifies its counties, county officials may be considered state officials for the limited purposes of liability in an Ex parte Young case. See Bostic, 760 F.3d at 371 n. 2. Further, the State, relying on Bockes v. Fields, 999 F.2d 788, 791 (4th Cir. 1993), maintains that if county officials “truly have no discretion under a state law or policy, they simply should not have been sued in the first place.” ECF No. 155. The State’s reliance on Bockes is misplaced. In Bockes, the plaintiff attempted to place liability on a county for the decision of a county board that acted -16-\\n\\n\\x0cimmunity and the fee award could be directed in part or in whole against the State in this Court’s discretion.” ECF No. 155. Alternatively, the State argues that even if it is not immune, no attorneys’ fees should be awarded against it. The State contends that it is not liable to Plaintiffs for the judgment and thus it should not be liable to them for attorneys’ fees.\\nThe Court agrees with Defendant Clerks. Sections 48-2-104 and 48-2-401 of the West Virginia Code were state laws prohibiting same-sex marriage. Each Plaintiff couple attempted to obtain a marriage license, and each was denied by one of the defendants pursuant to these state laws. See ECF No. 8. The State has not provided, and the Court has not found, any evidence that Defendant Clerks were administering county rules or policies rather than state law. Moreover, the clerks had no discretion to disregard state law and issue marriage licenses to the plaintiffs. West Virginia law specifically forbids county clerks from “issu[ing] a marriage license contrary to law.” W. Va. Code § 48-2-502 (2001). Any clerk who issues such a license “shall be punished by a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars, or by confinement in the county or regional jail for not more than one year, or by both.” Id. It is clear that Defendant Clerks were required by state law to deny marriage licenses to the plaintiffs and administered state law when they did so. The clerks were thus acting as state agents, rather than county officials, at the time of Plaintiffs’ injuries. Accordingly, they are considered state officials for the purposes of this Ex parte Young suit. See Bostic, 760 F.3d at 371 n. 2; Brotherton, 173 F.3d at 566.\\npursuant to state policy. The court held that the county was not liable because the decision was the result of state, not county, policy. In contrast, construing the county clerks in the present case as state officials would place liability on the entity actually responsible for enacting the challenged laws—the State. Moreover, the clerks sued were the officials responsible for enforcing West Virginia’s unconstitutional ban on same-sex marriage. They denied marriage licenses to the plaintiffs and thereby caused Plaintiffs’ injuries. Defendant Clerks were thus proper officials to sue in order to challenge the State’s ban on same-sex marriage, even though other officials could have been proper defendants as well.\\n-17-\\n\\n\\x0cFurthermore, although not named as a defendant in this case, the State was clearly the intended target of this litigation. See Hutto, 437 U.S. at 700 (“[S]uits brought against individual officers for injunctive relief are for all practical purposes suits against the State itself.”). Not only did the Court grant an injunction preventing the clerks from administering the same-sex marriage ban, it declared two of the State’s laws unconstitutional. This declaration is part and parcel of the total relief obtained and shows that the State, not the clerks, is responsible for the legislation that violated Plaintiffs’ civil rights. For the foregoing reasons, the attorneys’ fees assessed against Defendant Clerks will be the responsibility of the State of West Virginia.\\nD. Total Fees and Costs Plaintiffs are awarded $92,125 in attorneys’ fees, including paralegal fees, and $7,679.64 in costs and expenses. All fees, costs, and expenses are assessed against Defendants in their official capacities as agents of the State of West Virginia.\\nConclusion As set forth above, Plaintiffs’ Motion for Attorneys’ Fees, Expenses, and Costs (ECF No. 145) is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. Plaintiffs’ Motion for Extension of Time in Which to File Reply in Support of Motion for Attorneys’ Fees, Expenses, and Costs (152) is DENIED AS MOOT.

            "On October 1, 2013, three same-sex couples and the minor child of one of the couples filed a lawsuit against Kanawha County, West Virginia in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia. The plaintiffs, represented by Lambda Legal Defense & Education Fund, asked the court to declare unconstitutional any West Virginia laws banning same-sex marriage, to enjoin West Virginia from refusing to recognize same-sex marriages undertaken in other states, and to award the plaintiffs reasonable attorney's fees and costs of suit.\n",
            "\n",
            "The plaintiffs claimed that their rights under the Due Process and Equal Protection clauses of the United States Constitution were violated. They further asserted that the ban on same-sex marriage discriminated on the basis of sexual orientation, sex, and parental status. The plaintiffs also alleged that they were being denied a multitude of other social and legal rights that marriage provides.\n",
            "\n",
            "On December 2, 2013, the Court (Judge Robert C. Chambers) granted the State of West Virginia's Motion to intervene as a defendant.  On January 29, 2014, The District Court (Robert C. Chambers, Chief Judge) held that: the Court would consider the case law, but not legal argument, contained in untimely notice of supplemental authority filed by plaintiffs; the action did not present difficult questions of state law, therefore the case would remain in federal court; the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge constitutionality of the non-recognition statute, however, the plaintiffs were allowed to challenge the other parts the West Virginia marriage ban. 993 F.

Schafer</a>, a Fourth Circuit case that had a substantial overlap in issues with McGee v. Cole. The holding in Bostic, that same-sex marriage bans are unconstitutional, controlled this case.\n",
            "\n",
            "On November 7, 2014, the Court, in keeping with <i>Bostic</i>, applied strict scrutiny to the marriage ban and found that it was not narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling state interest, and decided in favor of the plaintiffs. It issued an opinion and order that granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, while denying the State of West Virginia's motion to dismiss. In the order, the Court disagreed that there would be uniformity problems regarding the enforcement of the marriage ban across the counties of West Virginia. While the defendants claimed that the decision would only ban the named clerks from denying same-sex couples marriage licenses, the Court found that would not be the case. The Court further held that the marriage ban was not a narrowly-tailored state interest and that it violated the plaintiffs' constitutional rights under the Due Process and Equal Protection Laws under the Fourteenth Amendment. The case ended on November 7, 2014.\n",

            " On May 1, 2013, two men who were arrested for trespassing on property open to the public filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan. The plaintiffs sued the City of Grand Rapids, its chief of police, and two individual officers under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The plaintiffs, represented by the National ACLU and ACLU of Michigan, asked the court for a declaratory judgment, damages, and injunctive relief concerning the use of \"No Trespass Letters.\" The plaintiffs claimed that the City of Grand Rapids, its chief of police, and police officers violated their Fourth Amendment rights. \n",

            "According to the amended complaint, the Grand Rapids Police Department (\"GRPD\") had arrested individuals for trespassing based on a City trespass ordinance, under which the City solicits No Trespass Letters from area businesses indicating their intent to prosecute trespassers. The plaintiffs alleged they were arrested for trespassing while sitting in their vehicles in a business's parking lot, without any warning or complaint from the business itself. The plaintiffs claimed their arrests were without probable cause and therefore in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Additionally, the plaintiffs claimed that the ordinance violated the void-for-vagueness doctrine of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\n",

            "\n",
            "On December 3, 2013, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' claims for injunctive and declaratory relief. They argued that the plaintiffs lacked standing to seek declaratory or injunctive relief because they were not suffering an imminent threat of repeated future misconduct. Additionally, defendants argued that the plaintiffs' claims for declaratory and injunctive relief were not ripe because the City had changed the No Trespass Letters following the plaintiffs' filling of the Complaint.

            "On August 4, 2014, the Judge Paul L. Maloney dismissed the claims of one of the plaintiffs against the defendants according to the parties' stipulation. However, the other plaintiffs' claims remained. \n",
            "\n",
            "While the motion to dismiss was still pending, the defendants and the plaintiffs both filed motions for summary judgment. In April 2015, the court postponed the trial date pending the resolution of multiple motions made by both the defendants and the plaintiffs. \n",
            "\n",
            "Following a hearing on the defendants' motion to dismiss, as well as both parties' motions for summary judgment, Judge Maloney granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' claims for injunctive and declaratory relief on June 21, 2017. 256 F.Supp.3d 742. The Court held that, because the plaintiffs had not alleged sufficient facts to present a threat of an imminent, as opposed to a speculative, injury, they lacked standing to seek declaratory and injunctive relief. The Court also noted that the City's changes to the No Trespass Letters following the filing of this case rendered the requests for prospective relief unripe. The Court did not, however, grant the defendants' motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' claim for damages. \n",

Maggitt, 903 N.W.2d 868 (Mich. Ct. App. 2017). Following the Michigan Court of Appeals' ruling, the City effectively ended its practice of arresting individuals pursuant to the No Trespass Letters.  \n",

            "The Court granted summary judgment for plaintiffs on their municipal liability claim against the City of Grand Rapids. The Court found that the City had an unconstitutional policy or custom whereby police officers arrested individuals for trespassing on property covered by a no-trespass letter without first informing the suspect that he or she must leave the property. However, the Court found that the plaintiffs had failed to show that the City's trespass ordinance was unconstitutionally vague. \n",
            "\n",
            "Additionally, the Court dismissed the plaintiffs' claims against the individual defendants because it found that the police officers were entitled to qualified immunity. At the time of the arrests, it was not clearly established law what knowledge the officers must have before concluding that they had probable cause to arrest a suspect for violating the City's ordinance.  \n",
            "\n",
            "After a February 4, 2019 conference with Judge Maloney, the parties appeared to move into settlement negotiations. Judge Maloney filed an order on April 12 stating that he had received word from the parties that they had settled the issue on the matter of damages. A damages amount was not publicly disclosed; the ACLU <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/cases/hightower-v-city-grand-rapids\">described</a> it as a \"favorable settlement agreement resulting in significant compensation for each of our four plaintiffs.\" The parties continued litigating over attorney fees, but came to a private agreement on the matter on December 23, 2019.

            " Two men who were arrested for trespassing on property of businesses open to the public filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan against the city of Grand Rapids, its chief of police, and two individual officers. The plaintiffs claimed that the Grand Rapids Police Department's policy and practice of arresting individuals for trespass -- without probable cause and based on general Letters of Intent to Prosecute signed by Grand Rapids businesses -- results in unreasonable searches and seizures in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The parties came to a private settlement agreement for damages and attorney's fees in late 2019. The Judge dismissed the case in early 2020.\n",

        "text='''On May 1, 2013, two men who were arrested for trespassing on property open to the public filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan. The plaintiffs sued the City of Grand Rapids, its chief of police, and two individual officers under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The plaintiffs, represented by the National ACLU and ACLU of Michigan, asked the court for a declaratory judgment, damages, and injunctive relief concerning the use of \"No Trespass Letters.\" The plaintiffs claimed that the City of Grand Rapids, its chief of police, and police officers violated their Fourth Amendment rights.\n",
        "\n",
        "According to the amended complaint, the Grand Rapids Police Department (\"GRPD\") had arrested individuals for trespassing based on a City trespass ordinance, under which the City solicits No Trespass Letters from area businesses indicating their intent to prosecute trespassers. The plaintiffs alleged they were arrested for trespassing while sitting in their vehicles in a business's parking lot, without any warning or complaint from the business itself. The plaintiffs claimed their arrests were without probable cause and therefore in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Additionally, the plaintiffs claimed that the ordinance violated the void-for-vagueness doctrine of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\n",
        "Amendment.\n",
        "\n",
        "On December 3, 2013, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' claims for injunctive and declaratory relief. They argued that the plaintiffs lacked standing to seek declaratory or injunctive relief because they were not suffering an imminent threat of repeated future misconduct. Additionally, defendants argued that the plaintiffs' claims for declaratory and injunctive relief were not ripe because the City had changed the No Trespass Letters following the plaintiffs' filling of the Complaint. Defendants did not challenge the Court's jurisdiction to hear the plaintiffs' claim for damages.\n",
        "\n",
        "On August 4, 2014, the Judge Paul L. Maloney dismissed the claims of one of the plaintiffs against the defendants according to the parties' stipulation. However, the other plaintiffs' claims remained.\n",
        "\n",
        "While the motion to dismiss was still pending, the defendants and the plaintiffs both filed motions for summary judgment. In April 2015, the court postponed the trial date pending the resolution of multiple motions made by both the defendants and the plaintiffs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Following a hearing on the defendants' motion to dismiss, as well as both parties' motions for summary judgment, Judge Maloney granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' claims for injunctive and declaratory relief on June 21, 2017. 256 F.Supp.3d 742. The Court held that, because the plaintiffs had not alleged sufficient facts to present a threat of an imminent, as opposed to a speculative, injury, they lacked standing to seek declaratory and injunctive relief. The Court also noted that the City's changes to the No Trespass Letters following the filing of this case rendered the requests for prospective relief unripe. The Court did not, however, grant the defendants' motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' claim for damages.\n",
        "\n",
        "Notably, the Michigan Court of Appeals addressed the same issue of whether the Grand Rapids ordinance is constitutional and held that it is unconstitutional. People v. Maggitt, 903 N.W.2d 868 (Mich. Ct. App. 2017). Following the Michigan Court of Appeals' ruling, the City effectively ended its practice of arresting individuals pursuant to the No Trespass Letters.\n",
        "\n",
        "On October 17, 2018, Judge Maloney held that both sides were entitled to partial summary judgment. 407 F.Supp.3d 707.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Court granted summary judgment for plaintiffs on their municipal liability claim against the City of Grand Rapids. The Court found that the City had an unconstitutional policy or custom whereby police officers arrested individuals for trespassing on property covered by a no-trespass letter without first informing the suspect that he or she must leave the property. However, the Court found that the plaintiffs had failed to show that the City's trespass ordinance was unconstitutionally vague.'''\n",
